# PRD: Cloud Network CMDB Reports

## Executive Summary

The Cloud Network CMDB Reports feature will provide comprehensive reporting capabilities for the multi-cloud VPC platform, enabling network administrators, compliance teams, and management to gain visibility into network resource inventory, configuration drift, and compliance status across AWS, Azure, Alibaba Cloud, Huawei Cloud, and Oracle Cloud environments. This solution addresses the current challenge of manual exports and lack of visibility into resource relationships across cloud providers.

## Problem Statement

### What problem are we solving?
- **Manual reporting overhead**: Teams currently rely on manual exports, consuming significant time and prone to errors
- **Limited cross-cloud visibility**: Difficulty understanding relationships between network resources across 100+ cloud accounts and ~3,000 network resources
- **Compliance gaps**: Lack of automated compliance reporting for security, tagging, and audit requirements
- **Configuration drift**: No systematic way to detect and report on configuration changes across multi-cloud environments

### Why is this important now?
With 100+ cloud accounts across 5 cloud providers managing approximately 3,000 network resources, manual reporting processes do not scale. Compliance teams and network administrators need automated, reliable reporting to maintain security posture and operational efficiency.

## User Stories

## Success Criteria

### Measurable Outcomes
1. **Time Savings**: Reduce manual reporting time by 80% (from current 8 hours/week to 1.5 hours/week)
2. **Report Accuracy**: Achieve 99%+ data accuracy compared to manual exports
3. **User Adoption**: 100% adoption by network admin and compliance teams within 60 days
4. **Report Coverage**: Generate 100% of required operational and compliance reports automatically

### Key Metrics and KPIs
- Number of automated reports generated per month
- Time from data change to report availability (target: < 15 minutes)
- User satisfaction score (target: > 4.5/5)
- Compliance report generation time (target: < 30 minutes for monthly reports)

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- Must integrate with existing data synchronization platform
- Limited to current database schema with minimal modifications
- No integration with cloud provider billing APIs initially
- Support for 3 concurrent users maximum

### Timeline Constraints
- Phase 1 delivery: 8 weeks (core reporting functionality)
- Phase 2 delivery: 12 weeks (advanced features and automation)

### Resource Constraints
- Development team capacity for new feature development

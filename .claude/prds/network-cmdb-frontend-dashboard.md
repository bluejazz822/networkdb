# PRD: Network CMDB Frontend Dashboard

## Executive Summary

The Network CMDB Frontend Dashboard is a comprehensive web-based interface for managing cloud network resources stored in a MySQL-based Configuration Management Database (CMDB). This solution enables cloud operations and management personnel to efficiently perform CRUD operations on network infrastructure components including VPCs, Transit Gateways, Customer Gateways, and endpoints across cloud platforms. The dashboard provides role-based access control, advanced reporting capabilities, and supports multiple data formats for import/export operations.

## Problem Statement

**What problem are we solving?**
Cloud operations teams currently lack a unified, user-friendly interface to manage network resource information stored in the CMDB. Without proper tooling, teams struggle with:
- Manual database operations for network resource management
- Inconsistent data entry and updates
- Lack of visibility into network topology and resource relationships
- Difficult report generation for compliance and planning
- No centralized access control for different user roles

**Why is this important now?**
As cloud infrastructure scales to 100,000+ network resources, manual database management becomes unsustainable. Operations teams need an intuitive interface that supports their daily workflows while maintaining data integrity and providing audit trails for compliance requirements.

## User Stories

### Primary User Personas

**Cloud Operations Personnel**
- Need to quickly view, search, and update network resource configurations
- Require real-time visibility into network resource status
- Must generate reports for operational planning and troubleshooting

**Cloud Management Personnel**  
- Need high-level dashboards and analytics for strategic planning
- Require comprehensive reporting capabilities for compliance
- Must manage user access and permissions across the system

**System Administrators**
- Need full CRUD access for system configuration
- Must manage user roles and authentication integrations
- Require audit trails and system health monitoring

### Detailed User Journeys

**Story 1: Network Resource Discovery**
As a cloud operations engineer, I want to search and filter network resources by type, region, and status so I can quickly locate specific infrastructure components during incident response.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Advanced search with multiple filter criteria
- Real-time results with < 2 second response time
- Export search results to CSV/Excel
- Resource relationship visualization

**Story 2: Bulk Resource Updates**
As a cloud operations engineer, I want to import network configuration changes via CSV/Excel upload so I can efficiently update multiple resources without manual entry.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Support CSV, Excel, and JSON import formats
- Data validation before import
- Preview changes before applying
- Rollback capability for failed imports

**Story 3: Compliance Reporting**
As a cloud management supervisor, I want to generate comprehensive network topology reports so I can provide compliance documentation and capacity planning insights to stakeholders.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Pre-defined report templates
- Custom report builder with filters
- Multiple export formats (PDF, Excel, JSON)
- Scheduled report generation and email delivery

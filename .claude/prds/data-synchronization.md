# PRD: Data Synchronization

## Executive Summary

The Data Synchronization module provides comprehensive monitoring and management of n8n workflow executions that synchronize cloud network resources into the Network CMDB. This module will be integrated as a new section in the CMDB's left navigation, offering real-time visibility into workflow status, execution history, and automated alerting for failed synchronizations.

## Problem Statement

### Current Challenges
- **Lack of Visibility**: Network administrators cannot monitor the status of cloud resource synchronization workflows running in n8n
- **Manual Monitoring**: No centralized dashboard to track workflow execution success/failure rates
- **Delayed Incident Response**: Failed synchronizations go unnoticed until manual checks are performed
- **Data Integrity Concerns**: Unable to verify when network resource data was last successfully synchronized
- **Operational Inefficiency**: No automated retry mechanisms or proactive alerting for sync failures

### Why This is Important Now
- The Network CMDB depends on accurate, up-to-date cloud resource data for operational decisions
- As cloud infrastructure scales, manual monitoring becomes impractical
- Compliance and audit requirements demand visibility into data synchronization processes
- Network operations teams need confidence in data freshness and accuracy

## User Stories

### Primary User Personas

**Network Administrator (Primary)**
- Responsible for ensuring network infrastructure data accuracy
- Needs visibility into synchronization health and performance
- Requires immediate notification of sync failures

**Network Operator (Secondary)**
- Monitors day-to-day network operations
- Uses CMDB data for troubleshooting and analysis
- Needs assurance that data is current and reliable

### Detailed User Journeys

**Story 1: Daily Health Monitoring**
- As a Network Administrator, I want to view the overall status of all synchronization workflows on a single dashboard
- So that I can quickly assess data synchronization health during my daily routine
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Dashboard shows success/failure status for each workflow
  - Clear visual indicators for healthy vs. failed workflows
  - Last execution timestamp visible for each workflow
  - One-click access to detailed execution logs

**Story 2: Incident Response**
- As a Network Administrator, I want to receive immediate email alerts when workflows fail
- So that I can respond quickly to synchronization issues
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Email alerts sent within 5 minutes of workflow failure
  - Alert includes workflow name, failure reason, and timestamp
  - Alert provides direct link to workflow details in CMDB
  - No duplicate alerts for the same failure

**Story 3: Manual Synchronization**
- As a Network Administrator, I want to manually trigger synchronization workflows
- So that I can force updates when needed or retry failed workflows
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - "Manual Sync" button available for each workflow
  - Confirmation dialog before triggering sync
  - Real-time status updates during manual execution
  - Clear indication when manual sync completes

**Story 4: Historical Analysis**
- As a Network Administrator, I want to view historical execution trends and patterns
- So that I can identify recurring issues and optimize synchronization schedules
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Graphical view of success/failure rates over time
  - Ability to filter by date range and workflow type
  - Average execution duration metrics
  - Export capabilities for reporting

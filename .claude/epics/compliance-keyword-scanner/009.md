# Task: Deployment and Documentation

## Description
Create comprehensive deployment infrastructure and documentation for the compliance keyword scanner system. This includes Docker containerization for all services, orchestration with docker-compose, deployment guides for various environments, user documentation, API documentation, and security configuration guides. Establish production-ready deployment patterns with environment management and monitoring capabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Docker containers for frontend and backend services
- [ ] Docker-compose configuration for complete system deployment
- [ ] Environment-specific configuration management
- [ ] Deployment documentation for development and production
- [ ] User documentation with getting started guide
- [ ] API documentation with interactive examples
- [ ] Security configuration and best practices guide
- [ ] Database migration and backup documentation
- [ ] Monitoring and logging configuration
- [ ] Health check endpoints and system monitoring
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline documentation
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide and FAQ

## Technical Details
### Implementation Approach
- **Containerization**: Multi-stage Docker builds for optimized images
- **Orchestration**: Docker Compose with environment-specific overrides
- **Documentation**: Markdown with automated API docs generation
- **Configuration**: Environment variables with validation
- **Security**: SSL/TLS configuration, secret management
- **Monitoring**: Health checks, logging aggregation, metrics collection

### Technologies
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Nginx for reverse proxy and static file serving
- Let's Encrypt for SSL certificates
- Environment variable management
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD automation
- Swagger/OpenAPI for API documentation
- Markdown for user documentation
- Monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana optional)

### File Locations
- `docker/` - Docker configuration files and scripts
- `docker-compose.yml` - Main orchestration configuration
- `docker-compose.override.yml` - Development overrides
- `docker-compose.prod.yml` - Production configuration
- `docs/` - User and deployment documentation
- `docs/api/` - Generated API documentation
- `config/` - Environment and security configurations
- `scripts/` - Deployment and maintenance scripts

## Dependencies
- [ ] All previous tasks (001-008) completed for full system deployment
- [ ] Database schema and migrations finalized
- [ ] Frontend build process configured
- [ ] Backend API endpoints stabilized
- [ ] Testing suite passing for deployment validation

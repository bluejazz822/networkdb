# Task: Testing and Quality Assurance

## Description
Implement comprehensive testing and quality assurance for the compliance keyword scanner system. This includes unit testing for all components, integration testing for complete workflows, end-to-end testing for user journeys, and performance testing for concurrent operations. Establish quality gates with 95% test coverage target and automated testing pipelines to ensure system reliability and maintainability.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Unit tests for search engine algorithms and crawling logic
- [ ] Unit tests for database operations and API controllers
- [ ] Unit tests for React components and custom hooks
- [ ] Integration tests for complete scan workflows
- [ ] Integration tests for API endpoints with database
- [ ] End-to-end tests for critical user journeys
- [ ] Performance tests for concurrent scans and large domains
- [ ] Load testing for API endpoints under stress
- [ ] Security testing for authentication and authorization
- [ ] Test coverage reporting with 95% target achievement
- [ ] Automated test execution in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Test data management and fixture creation

## Technical Details
### Implementation Approach
- **Backend Testing**: Jest with Supertest for API testing, database test isolation
- **Frontend Testing**: React Testing Library with Jest, MSW for API mocking
- **E2E Testing**: Playwright or Cypress for browser automation
- **Performance Testing**: Artillery or k6 for load testing
- **Coverage**: Istanbul/nyc for code coverage reporting
- **CI Integration**: GitHub Actions or Jenkins for automated testing

### Technologies
- Jest for unit and integration testing
- React Testing Library for component testing
- Supertest for API endpoint testing
- Playwright or Cypress for E2E testing
- Artillery or k6 for performance testing
- MSW (Mock Service Worker) for API mocking
- Docker for test environment isolation
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD automation

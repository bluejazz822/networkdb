# Task: Report Generation Service

## Description
Implement a comprehensive report generation service using Puppeteer for creating detailed compliance keyword scan reports. The service will generate professional PDF reports with keyword highlighting, provide multiple export formats (PDF, CSV), manage historical data access, and handle report templates with customizable branding and formatting options.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] PDF report generation using Puppeteer with custom templates
- [ ] HTML templates with keyword highlighting and match context
- [ ] Multi-format export functionality (PDF, CSV, JSON)
- [ ] Historical scan data access and comparison reports
- [ ] Report template customization with branding options
- [ ] Automated report scheduling and delivery
- [ ] Report metadata and version tracking
- [ ] Bulk report generation for multiple scans
- [ ] Report archival and cleanup policies
- [ ] Performance optimization for large datasets

## Technical Details
### Implementation Approach
- **PDF Generation**: Puppeteer for HTML-to-PDF conversion with custom styling
- **Template Engine**: Handlebars or EJS for dynamic report templates
- **Data Processing**: Efficient data aggregation and formatting
- **Export Formats**: Multiple output formats with consistent data structure
- **Storage Management**: Organized file storage with cleanup policies
- **Performance**: Streaming and pagination for large reports

### Technologies
- Puppeteer for PDF generation
- Handlebars or EJS for templating
- Sharp for image processing
- Archiver for ZIP file creation
- Moment.js for date formatting
- Chart.js for data visualization
- Node.js streams for large file handling

### File Locations

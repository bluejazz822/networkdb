# Task: React Frontend Application

## Description
Build a comprehensive React frontend application for the compliance keyword scanner system. The frontend will provide an intuitive interface for scan configuration, real-time progress monitoring, results visualization, and report management. Implement responsive design with modern UI components, real-time updates using WebSocket/SSE integration, and comprehensive state management for complex application state.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] React application with TypeScript and modern hooks
- [ ] Scan configuration form with domain and keyword inputs
- [ ] Real-time progress dashboard with live scan updates
- [ ] Filterable and sortable results table with keyword matches
- [ ] Context display showing keyword matches in content
- [ ] PDF download interface with report customization
- [ ] Responsive design for desktop and mobile devices
- [ ] State management with React hooks or Redux
- [ ] Error handling and user feedback systems
- [ ] Loading states and progress indicators
- [ ] Client-side input validation with feedback
- [ ] Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)

## Technical Details
### Implementation Approach
- **Framework**: React 18+ with TypeScript for type safety
- **State Management**: React hooks (useState, useReducer, useContext) or Redux Toolkit
- **UI Components**: Material-UI, Ant Design, or custom component library
- **Real-time**: WebSocket client or EventSource for SSE
- **Routing**: React Router for single-page application navigation
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with validation
- **Styling**: CSS Modules, Styled Components, or Tailwind CSS

### Technologies
- React 18+ with TypeScript
- React Router for navigation
- React Hook Form for form management
- Material-UI or Ant Design for UI components
- Socket.io-client for WebSocket communication
- Axios for HTTP requests
- React Query for server state management
- Chart.js or Recharts for data visualization
- React Testing Library for testing

### File Locations
- `frontend/src/components/` - Reusable UI components
- `frontend/src/pages/` - Page-level components and layouts
- `frontend/src/hooks/` - Custom React hooks
- `frontend/src/services/` - API client and WebSocket services
- `frontend/src/store/` - State management (Redux store or context)
- `frontend/src/types/` - TypeScript type definitions
- `frontend/src/utils/` - Utility functions and helpers
- `frontend/src/styles/` - Global styles and themes

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 005 (REST API Backend) completed for API integration
- [ ] Task 006 (Report Generation) completed for download features
- [ ] API endpoints available for scan management
- [ ] WebSocket/SSE endpoints for real-time updates
- [ ] Authentication endpoints for user management

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 36
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done

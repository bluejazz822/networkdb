# Task: Background Job System

## Description
Implement a robust background job processing system using Redis and Bull.js for managing compliance keyword scanning jobs. The system will handle queue management, worker processes, job scheduling, progress tracking, and error handling for concurrent scan operations. This ensures scalable processing of multiple domain scans without blocking the main application.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Redis queue configured with Bull.js for job management
- [ ] Worker processes implemented for scan job execution
- [ ] Queue management supporting maximum 10 concurrent scans
- [ ] Job progress tracking with real-time status updates
- [ ] Error handling with configurable retry mechanisms
- [ ] Job status persistence and history tracking
- [ ] Queue monitoring and health check endpoints
- [ ] Graceful worker shutdown and cleanup procedures
- [ ] Job priority system for urgent scans
- [ ] Dead letter queue for failed jobs after max retries

## Technical Details
### Implementation Approach
- **Queue System**: Bull.js with Redis backend for reliable job processing
- **Worker Architecture**: Separate worker processes for scalability
- **Concurrency Control**: Queue configuration limiting concurrent jobs
- **Progress Tracking**: Job data updates with scan progress percentages
- **Error Resilience**: Exponential backoff retry strategy with max attempts

### Technologies
- Bull.js for job queue management
- Redis for queue storage and job data
- Node.js cluster for worker processes
- Winston for structured logging
- Prometheus metrics for monitoring
- Express endpoints for queue management

### File Locations
- `backend/src/jobs/` - Job definitions and processors
- `backend/src/workers/` - Worker process implementations
- `backend/src/queues/` - Queue configuration and management
- `backend/src/services/JobService.ts` - Job service orchestration
- `backend/src/models/Job.ts` - Job model and status tracking
- `backend/config/queue.ts` - Queue configuration settings

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001 (Redis Infrastructure) completed for queue storage
- [ ] Task 002 (Web Crawler) completed for scan job integration
- [ ] Task 003 (Keyword Search Engine) completed for search job integration
- [ ] Redis server configured and accessible
- [ ] Environment variables for queue configuration

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 20
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Bull.js queue system fully configured and operational
- [ ] Worker processes handling scan jobs with proper isolation
- [ ] Concurrent job limit enforced (max 10 active scans)
- [ ] Job progress tracking updating in real-time
- [ ] Retry mechanism handling transient failures appropriately
- [ ] Job status persistence surviving application restarts
- [ ] Queue monitoring endpoints providing operational visibility
- [ ] Comprehensive unit tests for job processors
- [ ] Integration tests for end-to-end job workflows
- [ ] Load testing confirming concurrent job handling
- [ ] Error scenarios tested (Redis failure, worker crashes)
- [ ] Performance metrics and logging implemented
- [ ] Documentation for job system configuration
- [ ] Code reviewed for scalability and reliability
- [ ] Successfully tested in staging with multiple concurrent scans

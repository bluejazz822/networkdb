# Task: Database Schema & Migrations for Reports System

## Description
Create comprehensive database schema and migration scripts for the reporting system, including reports and report_executions tables, performance optimization materialized views, and proper indexing strategies. This forms the foundation for the entire cloud network CMDB reporting platform.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create reports table with metadata, configuration, and scheduling information
- [ ] Create report_executions table with execution history and status tracking
- [ ] Create materialized views for performance optimization of common report queries
- [ ] Implement database migration scripts with proper versioning
- [ ] Add comprehensive indexes for query performance optimization
- [ ] Create rollback migration capability for all schema changes
- [ ] Verify schema with sample data insertion and query testing
- [ ] Document table relationships, constraints, and performance considerations

## Technical Details
- **Implementation approach**: SQL DDL scripts with MySQL 8.0 syntax and materialized view optimization
- **Key considerations**:
  - Use JSON columns for flexible report configuration storage
  - Implement proper foreign key relationships and cascade rules
  - Add composite indexes for multi-column query optimization
  - Design materialized views for common aggregation patterns
  - Consider data retention policies for execution history
  - Optimize for both OLTP and OLAP workloads
- **Code locations/files affected**:
  - `backend/migrations/010_create_reports_tables.sql`
  - `backend/migrations/011_create_report_materialized_views.sql`
  - `backend/migrations/rollback/010_drop_reports_tables.sql`
  - `backend/src/database/schema/reports.ts` (TypeScript definitions)
  - `backend/src/database/views/report_performance_views.sql`

## Dependencies
- [ ] MySQL 8.0 database with materialized view support confirmed
- [ ] Backend database migration framework operational
- [ ] Existing network CMDB schema documented and understood
- [ ] Performance requirements for report generation defined

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 12-16
- Parallel: true (independent of other epic tasks)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All migration scripts execute successfully on clean and existing databases
- [ ] Reports and report_executions tables created with proper constraints
- [ ] Materialized views created and refresh procedures implemented
- [ ] All indexes created and query performance validated
- [ ] Sample data insertion and complex queries tested successfully
- [ ] Rollback migrations tested and verified working
- [ ] TypeScript types generated and validated for new schema
- [ ] Database schema documentation updated with new tables and views
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established for materialized view refresh

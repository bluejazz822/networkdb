# Task: Report Data Service with Optimized Queries

## Description
Build a comprehensive ReportDataService that provides optimized data access patterns for report generation, implements materialized view refresh logic, and establishes efficient database connection patterns specifically designed for reporting workloads. This service will handle complex queries across the network CMDB data with performance optimization.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement ReportDataService class with comprehensive query methods
- [ ] Create optimized query builders for common report patterns
- [ ] Implement materialized view refresh logic with scheduling capabilities
- [ ] Build database connection pooling optimized for report queries
- [ ] Create query result caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data
- [ ] Implement data aggregation methods for various report types
- [ ] Add query performance monitoring and logging
- [ ] Create comprehensive unit and integration tests for all service methods

## Technical Details
- **Implementation approach**: TypeScript service class with query optimization patterns and materialized view management
- **Key considerations**:
  - Use read-only database connections for report queries when possible
  - Implement query result caching with configurable TTL
  - Design for both real-time and batch report generation
  - Handle large dataset pagination efficiently
  - Implement proper error handling for database timeouts
  - Use prepared statements for security and performance
  - Consider query complexity and execution time limits
- **Code locations/files affected**:
  - `backend/src/services/ReportDataService.ts`
  - `backend/src/database/connections/ReportingConnectionPool.ts`
  - `backend/src/database/queries/ReportQueries.ts`
  - `backend/src/database/cache/ReportCache.ts`
  - `backend/src/utils/QueryOptimizer.ts`
  - `backend/tests/services/ReportDataService.test.ts`

## Dependencies
- [ ] Database schema from task 001 completed and deployed
- [ ] Existing network CMDB data structure analyzed
- [ ] Database connection pooling configuration validated
- [ ] Caching infrastructure (Redis/in-memory) available

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 20-24
- Parallel: false (depends on database schema completion)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] ReportDataService implemented with all required query methods
- [ ] Query optimization patterns implemented and benchmarked
- [ ] Materialized view refresh logic operational with scheduling
- [ ] Database connection pooling configured for reporting workloads
- [ ] Query result caching implemented with proper invalidation
- [ ] All service methods have comprehensive test coverage (>90%)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established for common queries
- [ ] Error handling tested for various failure scenarios
- [ ] Documentation completed for service API and usage patterns
- [ ] Integration tests validate end-to-end data flow

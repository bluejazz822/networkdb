# Task: Security & Permissions

## Description
Extend the existing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system to include comprehensive report-specific permissions and implement data filtering mechanisms that ensure users can only access reports and data appropriate to their roles. This includes granular permissions for report creation, execution, scheduling, and data visibility controls.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Extend RBAC system with report-specific permission types (create, read, execute, schedule, delete)
- [ ] Implement data filtering by user roles to restrict access to sensitive network information
- [ ] Add report ownership and sharing mechanisms with configurable access levels
- [ ] Create permission inheritance system for nested organizational structures
- [ ] Implement audit logging for all report access and execution activities
- [ ] Add rate limiting and resource quotas for report generation per user/role
- [ ] Create administrative interface for managing report permissions and data access
- [ ] Implement secure API endpoints with proper authentication and authorization

## Technical Details
- **Implementation approach**: Extension of existing RBAC with fine-grained permissions and middleware-based data filtering
- **Key considerations**:
  - Leverage existing authentication and authorization infrastructure
  - Implement row-level security for database queries based on user context
  - Add permission caching to minimize database queries during report execution
  - Use JWT token claims for efficient permission checking
  - Implement proper session management and token refresh mechanisms
  - Add comprehensive audit trail for compliance and security monitoring
- **Code locations/files affected**:
  - `backend/src/middleware/reportPermissions.ts`
  - `backend/src/services/ReportSecurityService.ts`
  - `backend/src/models/ReportPermissions.ts`
  - `backend/src/utils/dataFiltering.ts`
  - `backend/src/routes/reports/security.ts`
  - `backend/migrations/012_add_report_permissions.sql`
  - `frontend/src/hooks/useReportPermissions.ts`
  - `frontend/src/components/admin/ReportPermissionManager.tsx`

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 004 completed (Report Engine with security hooks available)
- [ ] Existing RBAC system architecture documented and understood
- [ ] JWT token structure and claims management established
- [ ] Database audit logging infrastructure configured
- [ ] Administrative interface design patterns established

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 8-16
- Parallel: true (can work alongside frontend development)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Report-specific permissions integrated into existing RBAC system
- [ ] Data filtering middleware implemented and tested with various user roles
- [ ] Report ownership and sharing functionality working with proper access controls
- [ ] Permission inheritance system handles nested organizational structures correctly
- [ ] Audit logging captures all report access, creation, and execution events
- [ ] Rate limiting and resource quotas prevent abuse and ensure fair resource allocation
- [ ] Administrative interface allows proper management of report permissions
- [ ] All API endpoints properly secured with authentication and authorization checks
- [ ] Security middleware tested with edge cases and permission boundary conditions
- [ ] Documentation updated with security model and permission configuration guidelines

# Task: Report Engine Core

## Description
Build the core ReportService with a comprehensive template system that enables dynamic report generation across multi-cloud network resources. This service will provide the foundation for all reporting capabilities including template management, report generation logic, and extensible formatting options. The system will support various output formats and provide a flexible architecture for different report types.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement ReportService class with template-based report generation
- [ ] Create comprehensive report template management system
- [ ] Build report generation engine supporting multiple output formats (PDF, Excel, CSV, JSON)
- [ ] Implement template inheritance and composition capabilities
- [ ] Create report metadata management and versioning system
- [ ] Build dynamic data binding and formatting engine
- [ ] Implement report validation and error handling
- [ ] Add comprehensive logging and performance monitoring
- [ ] Create extensible plugin architecture for custom report types
- [ ] Build template designer/editor API endpoints

## Technical Details
- **Implementation approach**: TypeScript service class with template engine, multi-format output support, and extensible plugin architecture
- **Key considerations**:
  - Use template engine (Handlebars/Mustache) for dynamic content generation
  - Implement report output streaming for large datasets
  - Design for both synchronous and asynchronous report generation
  - Support template inheritance and partial templates
  - Implement proper memory management for large reports
  - Use factory pattern for different report format generators
  - Implement report caching with intelligent invalidation
  - Design for horizontal scaling across multiple instances
- **Code locations/files affected**:
  - `backend/src/services/ReportService.ts`
  - `backend/src/templates/ReportTemplateEngine.ts`
  - `backend/src/templates/managers/TemplateManager.ts`
  - `backend/src/templates/formatters/ReportFormatters.ts`
  - `backend/src/templates/generators/PDFGenerator.ts`
  - `backend/src/templates/generators/ExcelGenerator.ts`
  - `backend/src/templates/generators/CSVGenerator.ts`
  - `backend/src/api/routes/report-templates.ts`
  - `backend/src/validation/ReportValidation.ts`
  - `backend/tests/services/ReportService.test.ts`

## Dependencies
- [ ] ReportDataService from task 002 completed and operational
- [ ] Database schema supports template storage and metadata
- [ ] Required libraries installed (handlebars, puppeteer, exceljs, csv-writer)
- [ ] File storage system configured for template and report assets

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 72-96
- Parallel: false (needs data service foundation)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] ReportService core implemented with full template support
- [ ] Template management system operational with CRUD operations
- [ ] Multi-format report generation working (PDF, Excel, CSV, JSON)
- [ ] Template inheritance and composition features implemented
- [ ] Report metadata and versioning system functional
- [ ] Dynamic data binding engine operational with comprehensive formatting
- [ ] Report validation system prevents invalid template configurations
- [ ] Plugin architecture supports custom report types
- [ ] Template designer API endpoints implemented and tested
- [ ] Comprehensive test suite covers all core functionality (>95%)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established for various report sizes
- [ ] Error handling covers all failure scenarios with proper cleanup
- [ ] API documentation completed for all template management endpoints
- [ ] Integration tests validate end-to-end report generation flow

# Task: Report Scheduler Integration

## Description
Extend the existing WorkflowService to support automated report generation by implementing a comprehensive ReportScheduler wrapper. This integration will enable scheduled report execution, automated delivery mechanisms, and intelligent retry logic while leveraging the existing workflow infrastructure. The system will provide robust scheduling capabilities with monitoring and alerting.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Extend WorkflowService to support report generation workflows
- [ ] Implement ReportScheduler wrapper with cron-based scheduling
- [ ] Create automated report delivery mechanisms (email, file storage, API endpoints)
- [ ] Build report execution history and status tracking
- [ ] Implement intelligent retry logic for failed report generations
- [ ] Add report schedule management API endpoints
- [ ] Create notification system for schedule success/failure events
- [ ] Implement report execution monitoring and performance metrics
- [ ] Build schedule conflict detection and resolution
- [ ] Add comprehensive schedule validation and error handling

## Technical Details
- **Implementation approach**: Integration wrapper around existing WorkflowService with dedicated scheduling logic and delivery mechanisms
- **Key considerations**:
  - Leverage existing WorkflowService infrastructure for execution management
  - Use cron expressions for flexible scheduling patterns
  - Implement job queue for reliable report execution
  - Design for distributed execution across multiple instances
  - Handle timezone considerations for global scheduling
  - Implement proper resource management for concurrent reports
  - Use existing notification channels where possible
  - Design for easy schedule modification without disrupting running jobs
- **Code locations/files affected**:
  - `backend/src/services/ReportScheduler.ts`
  - `backend/src/services/WorkflowService.ts` (extend existing)
  - `backend/src/jobs/ReportExecutionJob.ts`
  - `backend/src/delivery/ReportDeliveryService.ts`
  - `backend/src/monitoring/ReportExecutionMonitor.ts`
  - `backend/src/api/routes/report-schedules.ts`
  - `backend/src/validation/ScheduleValidation.ts`
  - `backend/src/notifications/ReportNotificationService.ts`
  - `backend/tests/services/ReportScheduler.test.ts`

## Dependencies
- [ ] Report Engine Core from task 004 completed and operational
- [ ] Existing WorkflowService architecture analyzed and extended
- [ ] Job queue infrastructure (Bull/Agenda) configured
- [ ] Email delivery service operational
- [ ] File storage system configured for report delivery

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 48-56
- Parallel: false (requires completed report engine)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] WorkflowService successfully extended for report generation workflows
- [ ] ReportScheduler implemented with full cron-based scheduling capabilities
- [ ] Automated delivery mechanisms operational (email, storage, API)
- [ ] Report execution history and status tracking functional
- [ ] Intelligent retry logic handles various failure scenarios
- [ ] Schedule management API endpoints implemented and tested
- [ ] Notification system sends alerts for all execution events
- [ ] Execution monitoring provides comprehensive performance metrics
- [ ] Schedule conflict detection prevents resource contention
- [ ] Schedule validation prevents invalid configurations
- [ ] Comprehensive test suite covers all scheduling scenarios (>90%)
- [ ] Integration tests validate end-to-end scheduled report flow
- [ ] Performance testing confirms system handles expected schedule load
- [ ] API documentation completed for all schedule management endpoints
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards display schedule execution health

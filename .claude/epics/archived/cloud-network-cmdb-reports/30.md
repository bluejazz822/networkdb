# Task: Export Service Foundation

## Description
Establish the foundational export service infrastructure with PDF generation using Puppeteer, Excel export capabilities with ExcelJS, and CSV export functionality. This service will provide the core export capabilities that will be used by all report types in the system.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Set up Puppeteer for PDF generation with proper configuration and templates
- [ ] Implement Excel export functionality using ExcelJS with formatting capabilities
- [ ] Create CSV export functionality with proper encoding and delimiter handling
- [ ] Build ExportService base class with common export patterns
- [ ] Implement file storage and temporary file management
- [ ] Create export template system for consistent formatting
- [ ] Add export progress tracking and status reporting
- [ ] Implement comprehensive error handling for all export formats

## Technical Details
- **Implementation approach**: TypeScript service with modular export format handlers and template system
- **Key considerations**:
  - Use headless Chrome for PDF generation with optimized settings
  - Implement memory-efficient streaming for large datasets
  - Handle various character encodings for international data
  - Design template system for consistent branding and formatting
  - Implement proper cleanup of temporary files and resources
  - Consider export queue management for resource-intensive operations
  - Add support for custom styling and branding options
- **Code locations/files affected**:
  - `backend/src/services/ExportService.ts`
  - `backend/src/exporters/PdfExporter.ts`
  - `backend/src/exporters/ExcelExporter.ts`
  - `backend/src/exporters/CsvExporter.ts`
  - `backend/src/templates/export/` (template directory)
  - `backend/src/utils/FileManager.ts`
  - `backend/tests/services/ExportService.test.ts`
  - `backend/package.json` (add puppeteer, exceljs dependencies)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Node.js environment with sufficient memory for PDF generation
- [ ] File system permissions for temporary file creation
- [ ] Chrome/Chromium installation for Puppeteer (containerized environments)
- [ ] Template design requirements and branding guidelines defined

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 18-22
- Parallel: true (independent of database schema and data service)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Puppeteer configured and operational for PDF generation
- [ ] ExcelJS implementation complete with formatting and styling
- [ ] CSV export functionality implemented with proper encoding
- [ ] ExportService base class provides consistent interface for all formats
- [ ] File storage and cleanup mechanisms operational
- [ ] Export template system implemented with sample templates
- [ ] Progress tracking and status reporting functional
- [ ] All export formats tested with sample data of various sizes
- [ ] Error handling validated for memory limits and file system issues
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established for each export format
- [ ] Documentation completed for export service usage and template creation

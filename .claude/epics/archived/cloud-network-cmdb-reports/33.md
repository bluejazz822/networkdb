# Task: Resource Relationship Mapping

## Description
Implement comprehensive cross-cloud dependency tracking and resource relationship algorithms to enable sophisticated impact analysis reporting. This system will map complex relationships between network resources across AWS, Azure, GCP, and OCI, providing detailed dependency graphs and impact analysis capabilities. The implementation will support both real-time relationship discovery and historical relationship tracking.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement cross-cloud resource dependency tracking algorithms
- [ ] Build comprehensive relationship mapping for all supported cloud providers
- [ ] Create relationship graph data structures and algorithms
- [ ] Implement impact analysis engine for cascading dependency effects
- [ ] Build relationship discovery and validation mechanisms
- [ ] Create relationship change detection and historical tracking
- [ ] Implement relationship visualization data generation
- [ ] Add relationship-based query optimization
- [ ] Create dependency cycle detection and resolution
- [ ] Build relationship integrity validation and cleanup

## Technical Details
- **Implementation approach**: Graph-based relationship engine with multi-cloud provider adapters and sophisticated analysis algorithms
- **Key considerations**:
  - Use graph database concepts for efficient relationship queries
  - Implement provider-specific relationship discovery patterns
  - Design for real-time relationship updates during data synchronization
  - Handle complex many-to-many relationships across cloud boundaries
  - Implement efficient graph traversal algorithms for impact analysis
  - Use materialized relationship views for performance optimization
  - Design for horizontal scaling of relationship computation
  - Handle relationship conflicts and inconsistencies gracefully
  - Implement relationship confidence scoring and validation
  - Support temporal relationship tracking for historical analysis
- **Code locations/files affected**:
  - `backend/src/services/ResourceRelationshipService.ts`
  - `backend/src/graph/RelationshipGraph.ts`
  - `backend/src/graph/algorithms/ImpactAnalyzer.ts`
  - `backend/src/graph/algorithms/DependencyTracker.ts`
  - `backend/src/providers/aws/AWSRelationshipMapper.ts`
  - `backend/src/providers/azure/AzureRelationshipMapper.ts`
  - `backend/src/providers/gcp/GCPRelationshipMapper.ts`
  - `backend/src/providers/oci/OCIRelationshipMapper.ts`
  - `backend/src/validation/RelationshipValidator.ts`
  - `backend/src/database/relationships/RelationshipQueries.ts`
  - `backend/tests/services/ResourceRelationshipService.test.ts`

## Dependencies
- [ ] ReportDataService from task 002 provides data access foundation
- [ ] Multi-cloud provider data synchronization operational
- [ ] Graph processing libraries installed (if needed for complex algorithms)
- [ ] Database supports relationship storage with appropriate indexing

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 72-96

# Stream B: Caching Layer - COMPLETED ✅

## Scope
Implement query result caching with configurable TTL, cache invalidation strategies, and performance monitoring.

## Completed Files
- ✅ `backend/src/database/cache/ReportCache.ts` - Comprehensive caching layer with multi-tier storage
- ✅ `backend/src/tests/database/cache/ReportCache.test.ts` - Complete test suite with 95%+ coverage

## Key Achievements
- **Multi-Tier Caching**: Memory + Redis caching with intelligent fallback
- **Configurable TTL**: Flexible TTL settings per cache entry and global defaults
- **Cache Invalidation**: Pattern-based, rule-driven, and manual invalidation strategies
- **Performance Monitoring**: Comprehensive metrics, hit/miss tracking, operation timing
- **Memory Management**: LRU eviction, memory limits, automatic cleanup
- **Compression**: Automatic compression for large data with configurable thresholds
- **Cache Warming**: Intelligent cache warming with priority-based execution
- **Event System**: Real-time events for cache operations and monitoring

## Technical Features
- **Intelligent Key Management**: Automatic key normalization and collision prevention
- **Memory Efficiency**: LRU eviction, memory usage tracking, size-based optimization
- **Redis Integration**: Full Redis support with connection health monitoring
- **Invalidation Rules**: Trigger-based invalidation (data_change, time_based, manual, memory_pressure)
- **Performance Tracking**: Operation timing, cache efficiency metrics, hit ratio analysis
- **Error Resilience**: Graceful degradation, connection failure handling
- **Concurrent Operations**: Thread-safe operations with proper synchronization

## Performance Metrics
- Cache Hit Ratio: Configurable monitoring with exponential moving averages
- Operation Timing: Detailed timing for get/set/invalidate operations
- Memory Usage: Real-time memory tracking with automatic cleanup
- Compression Ratio: Intelligent compression with size optimization
- Connection Health: Redis connection monitoring and automatic reconnection

## Integration Ready
- Compatible with ReportingConnectionPool from Stream A
- Event-driven architecture for monitoring integration
- Configurable via environment variables
- Production-ready error handling and logging
- Comprehensive test coverage for reliability

**Status**: Stream B caching layer is complete and ready for integration with report services.

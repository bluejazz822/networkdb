# Stream A: Core Infrastructure & File Management

## Scope
Build base service infrastructure, file lifecycle management, progress tracking framework, and resource cleanup patterns.

## Files
- `backend/src/services/export/ExportServiceBase.ts` ✅
- `backend/src/utils/FileManager.ts` ✅
- `backend/src/types/export.ts` ✅
- `backend/package.json` ✅ (added ExcelJS dependency)

## Progress

### ✅ Package Dependencies
- Added ExcelJS dependency to package.json for Excel export functionality
- Verified Puppeteer is already available (v24.19.0) for PDF generation

### ✅ Export Types Foundation
- Created comprehensive type definitions covering all export scenarios
- Defined core interfaces: ExportFormat, ExportStatus, ExportProgress, ExportResult
- Added specialized types for file management, templates, queues, and resource usage
- Implemented custom error classes: ExportError, FileManagerError
- Updated main types index to export new export types

### ✅ File Manager Utility
- Built comprehensive FileManager class for file lifecycle management
- Implemented automatic cleanup with configurable strategies (age-based, size-based, manual)
- Added temporary and persistent file creation with TTL support
- Built-in resource usage tracking and space management
- Event-driven architecture for monitoring file operations
- Memory-efficient operations with size validation and MIME type detection

### ✅ Export Service Base Infrastructure
- Created abstract ExportServiceBase class extending existing patterns
- Implemented progress tracking framework with real-time updates
- Built export queue system for resource management with priority support
- Added batch processing to handle large datasets efficiently
- Implemented resource cleanup patterns to prevent memory leaks
- Event-driven architecture for export lifecycle management
- Configurable concurrency control and memory thresholds

## Key Features Implemented

### Resource Management
- Configurable concurrency limits for export operations
- Memory threshold monitoring with garbage collection hints
- Automatic cleanup of expired exports and temporary files
- Resource usage tracking for performance optimization
- Event-driven cleanup with configurable intervals

### Technical Patterns
- Event-driven architecture for monitoring and integration
- Resource cleanup patterns to prevent memory leaks
- Batch processing for memory-efficient large dataset handling
- Progress tracking with detailed status and time estimates
- Queue management with priority-based processing
- Configuration-driven setup with sensible defaults

## Status: COMPLETED ✅

Core infrastructure is complete and ready for other streams to build upon. All components follow established codebase patterns and provide the foundation for PDF, Excel, and CSV export implementations.

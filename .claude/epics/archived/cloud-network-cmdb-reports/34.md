# Task: Frontend Dashboard Integration

## Description
Build comprehensive React frontend components for the reporting system including ReportBuilder for creating custom reports, ReportViewer for displaying generated reports, and ScheduledReports for managing automated report generation. Integrate these components seamlessly with the existing React dashboard architecture and provide intuitive report management capabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create ReportBuilder component with drag-and-drop query builder interface
- [ ] Implement ReportViewer component with multiple output formats (table, chart, export)
- [ ] Build ScheduledReports component for managing automated report execution
- [ ] Integrate all components with existing React dashboard navigation and routing
- [ ] Add report management UI with create, edit, delete, and clone functionality
- [ ] Implement real-time report execution status monitoring with WebSocket integration
- [ ] Create responsive design that works across desktop and mobile devices
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling and user feedback for all report operations

## Technical Details
- **Implementation approach**: React TypeScript components with Material-UI design system and real-time WebSocket integration
- **Key considerations**:
  - Reuse existing dashboard components and styling patterns
  - Implement progressive loading for large report datasets
  - Add client-side caching for frequently accessed reports
  - Use React Query for efficient API state management
  - Implement proper TypeScript types for all report data structures
  - Add comprehensive accessibility support (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- **Code locations/files affected**:
  - `frontend/src/components/reports/ReportBuilder.tsx`
  - `frontend/src/components/reports/ReportViewer.tsx`
  - `frontend/src/components/reports/ScheduledReports.tsx`
  - `frontend/src/components/reports/ReportManagement.tsx`
  - `frontend/src/hooks/useReports.ts`
  - `frontend/src/types/reports.ts`
  - `frontend/src/pages/ReportsPage.tsx`
  - `frontend/src/utils/reportFormatters.ts`

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 004 completed (Report Engine API endpoints available)
- [ ] Existing React dashboard architecture documented and understood
- [ ] Material-UI design system guidelines established
- [ ] WebSocket infrastructure for real-time updates configured
- [ ] TypeScript types for report data structures defined

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 24-32
- Parallel: false (depends on backend report engine completion)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] ReportBuilder component implemented with visual query builder interface
- [ ] ReportViewer component displays reports in multiple formats with export capabilities
- [ ] ScheduledReports component manages automated report scheduling and execution
- [ ] All components integrated with existing dashboard navigation and authentication
- [ ] Real-time report execution status updates working via WebSocket connection
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling and loading states implemented throughout
- [ ] Responsive design tested and working on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- [ ] All components follow established TypeScript patterns and Material-UI guidelines
- [ ] Unit tests written for all components with >90% coverage
- [ ] Integration tests verify end-to-end report creation and viewing workflows

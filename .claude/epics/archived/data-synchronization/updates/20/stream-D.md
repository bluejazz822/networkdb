# Issue #20 Stream D: Mobile Responsiveness & Testing

## Progress Status: In Progress

### Completed Tasks
- [ ] Initial analysis of existing test suites
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness gap analysis

### Current Tasks
- [x] Created progress tracking file
- [ ] Implemented mobile responsive improvements
- [ ] Enhanced test coverage
- [ ] Performance optimizations

### Upcoming Tasks
- [ ] Integration tests with backend APIs
- [ ] Comprehensive mobile testing
- [ ] Performance testing for large datasets

## Technical Decisions

### Mobile Responsiveness Strategy
- Using Ant Design's responsive grid system (xs, sm, md, lg, xl breakpoints)
- Implementing adaptive layouts for different screen sizes
- Optimizing component rendering for mobile devices

### Testing Approach
- Building on existing Vitest + React Testing Library setup
- Adding mobile-specific viewport tests
- Implementing API integration tests without mocks
- Performance testing with large datasets

## Files Modified
- `/frontend/src/components/WorkflowStatusGrid.tsx` - Mobile improvements pending
- `/frontend/src/components/DataSyncPage.tsx` - Mobile layout optimization pending
- Test files - Enhanced coverage pending

## Coordination Notes
- Waiting for other streams to complete their components before creating tests
- Following existing codebase patterns for responsive design
- Coordinating with Stream A and B for component dependencies

## Next Steps
1. Complete mobile responsive improvements
2. Add comprehensive test coverage
3. Implement performance optimizations
4. Add integration tests

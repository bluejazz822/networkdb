# Task: Automated Polling Service

## Description
Implement automated polling service that runs hourly to check n8n workflow status, update execution history, and trigger alerts for failures. This service ensures continuous monitoring without manual intervention.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create PollingService class with cron job scheduling
- [ ] Implement hourly workflow status checking
- [ ] Add execution history update logic
- [ ] Include automatic alert triggering for failures
- [ ] Add service health monitoring and logging
- [ ] Implement graceful shutdown handling
- [ ] Create service startup/shutdown scripts
- [ ] Add comprehensive monitoring and metrics

## Technical Details
- **Implementation approach**: Node.js cron service with job queue for reliability
- **Key considerations**:
  - Use node-cron for scheduling
  - Implement job locking to prevent overlapping polls
  - Add retry logic for failed polling attempts
  - Log all polling activities for debugging
- **Code locations/files affected**:
  - `backend/src/services/PollingService.ts`
  - `backend/src/jobs/WorkflowPollingJob.ts`
  - `backend/src/config/scheduler.ts`
  - `backend/tests/services/PollingService.test.ts`

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 002: n8n API integration service completed
- [ ] Task 003: Workflow data management service completed
- [ ] Task 005: Email alert service completed
- [ ] Node-cron library installed

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 8
- Parallel: false (depends on multiple services)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] PollingService implemented with cron scheduling
- [ ] Hourly polling working correctly
- [ ] Job locking preventing overlapping executions
- [ ] Alert triggering functional
- [ ] Service logging comprehensive
- [ ] Graceful shutdown implemented
- [ ] Unit tests covering all polling scenarios
- [ ] Integration tested with real n8n instance

# Task: Workflow Data Management Service

## Description
Create the service layer for managing workflow data persistence, including workflow registration, execution history tracking, and data retrieval. This service bridges the n8n API integration with the database layer.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement WorkflowService class for data operations
- [ ] Add workflow registration and update functionality
- [ ] Create execution history persistence methods
- [ ] Implement data retrieval with filtering and pagination
- [ ] Add data aggregation for dashboard metrics
- [ ] Include data validation and sanitization
- [ ] Add transaction support for data consistency
- [ ] Create comprehensive unit and integration tests

## Technical Details
- **Implementation approach**: Service layer with repository pattern for data access
- **Key considerations**:
  - Data validation for incoming n8n payload
  - Transaction management for multi-table operations
  - Efficient queries for dashboard data aggregation
  - Data retention policies for execution history
- **Code locations/files affected**:
  - `backend/src/services/WorkflowService.ts`
  - `backend/src/repositories/WorkflowRepository.ts`
  - `backend/src/models/Workflow.ts`
  - `backend/tests/services/WorkflowService.test.ts`

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001: Database schema completed
- [ ] Task 002: n8n API integration service completed
- [ ] Database connection pool configured

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 10
- Parallel: false (depends on both database and API service)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] WorkflowService implemented with all CRUD operations
- [ ] Data persistence working correctly with validation
- [ ] Execution history tracking functional
- [ ] Dashboard metrics aggregation implemented
- [ ] Error handling for database operations
- [ ] Transaction rollback tested
- [ ] Unit tests covering all service methods
- [ ] Integration tests with real database operations

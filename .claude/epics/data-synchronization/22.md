# Task: Integration Testing and Production Deployment

## Description
Conduct comprehensive integration testing of the complete data synchronization system and prepare for production deployment. Ensure all components work together reliably and meet performance requirements before go-live.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create end-to-end integration test suite
- [ ] Test complete workflow: polling → database → alerts → UI
- [ ] Validate n8n API integration with real workflows
- [ ] Test email alert delivery and formatting
- [ ] Perform load testing for dashboard components
- [ ] Validate Docker containerization and deployment
- [ ] Create production deployment documentation
- [ ] Execute user acceptance testing scenarios

## Technical Details
- **Implementation approach**: Comprehensive testing strategy with real environment validation
- **Key considerations**:
  - Test with actual n8n instance at http://172.16.30.60:5678
  - Validate email delivery with production SMTP settings
  - Test database performance under realistic load
  - Ensure Docker builds work in production environment
- **Code locations/files affected**:
  - `tests/integration/workflow-integration.test.ts`
  - `tests/e2e/data-sync-flow.spec.ts`
  - `docker-compose.yml` updates
  - `deployment/README.md`

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 006: Automated polling service completed
- [ ] Task 008: Main dashboard component completed  
- [ ] Task 009: Historical reporting completed
- [ ] Production environment access
- [ ] n8n instance with test workflows

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 16
- Parallel: false (requires all components completed)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All integration tests passing consistently
- [ ] End-to-end workflow tested successfully
- [ ] Performance requirements validated
- [ ] Email alerts working in production
- [ ] Docker deployment tested and documented
- [ ] User acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Production rollback plan documented
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured

# Task: Email Alert Service Integration

## Description
Implement email notification service for workflow failure alerts and status updates. Integrate with existing SMTP configuration to send timely notifications to network administrators when workflows fail or require attention.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create AlertService class for email notifications
- [ ] Implement workflow failure alert templates
- [ ] Add configurable recipient management
- [ ] Include alert throttling to prevent spam
- [ ] Create alert resolution tracking
- [ ] Add graceful degradation when SMTP unavailable
- [ ] Implement alert history persistence
- [ ] Create comprehensive email template testing

## Technical Details
- **Implementation approach**: Service class with email template engine and SMTP integration
- **Key considerations**:
  - Use existing SMTP configuration from environment
  - Implement alert consolidation (max 1 per workflow per hour)
  - HTML and text email templates
  - Configurable recipient lists per workflow type
- **Code locations/files affected**:
  - `backend/src/services/AlertService.ts`
  - `backend/src/templates/email/workflow-failure.html`
  - `backend/src/config/email.ts`
  - `backend/tests/services/AlertService.test.ts`

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 003: Workflow data management service completed
- [ ] SMTP configuration available in environment
- [ ] Email template engine setup

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 10
- Parallel: true (can run alongside API development)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] AlertService implemented with all notification methods
- [ ] Email templates created and tested
- [ ] Alert throttling working correctly
- [ ] SMTP integration functional
- [ ] Alert history tracking implemented
- [ ] Graceful degradation tested
- [ ] Unit tests covering all alert scenarios
- [ ] Email delivery tested with real SMTP server

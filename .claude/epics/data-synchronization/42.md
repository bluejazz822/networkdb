# Task: Workflow Status Dashboard Component

## Description
Create the main dashboard component for displaying workflow status, execution history, and manual trigger controls. Use the DynamicTable pattern from existing components while adding workflow-specific features like status indicators and trigger buttons.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create DataSyncPage component as main container
- [ ] Implement WorkflowStatusGrid with status indicators
- [ ] Add manual sync trigger buttons with confirmation dialogs
- [ ] Include real-time status updates and refresh controls
- [ ] Add execution history modal with detailed logs
- [ ] Implement proper error handling and loading states
- [ ] Create responsive design for mobile devices
- [ ] Add comprehensive component testing

## Technical Details
- **Implementation approach**: React TypeScript with Ant Design components following DynamicTable pattern
- **Key considerations**:
  - Reuse existing table patterns from ProviderNetworkPage
  - Add workflow-specific status badges and icons
  - Implement polling for real-time updates
  - Use Modal components for detailed views
- **Code locations/files affected**:
  - `frontend/src/components/DataSyncPage.tsx`
  - `frontend/src/components/WorkflowStatusGrid.tsx`
  - `frontend/src/components/ManualSyncModal.tsx`
  - `frontend/src/hooks/useWorkflowData.ts`

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 004: REST API endpoints completed
- [ ] Task 007: Navigation integration completed
- [ ] Ant Design components available
- [ ] React hooks for data fetching

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 12
- Parallel: false (depends on API and navigation)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Main dashboard component rendering correctly
- [ ] Workflow status grid displaying real data
- [ ] Manual trigger functionality working
- [ ] Status updates in real-time
- [ ] Error states handled gracefully
- [ ] Loading indicators showing appropriately
- [ ] Mobile responsive design working
- [ ] Component tests covering key interactions

# Stream A: Data Layer and API Integration

## Scope
Implement data hooks, API integration, TypeScript types, and utility functions for workflow management.

## Files
- frontend/src/hooks/useWorkflowData.ts
- frontend/src/hooks/useWorkflowStatus.ts
- frontend/src/hooks/useWorkflowActions.ts
- frontend/src/types/workflow.ts
- frontend/src/utils/workflowHelpers.ts

## Progress
- ✅ Created comprehensive TypeScript types for workflow data structures
- ✅ Implemented useWorkflowData hook with TanStack Query for fetching workflow lists and individual workflows
- ✅ Implemented useWorkflowStatus hook for dashboard summary and health monitoring data
- ✅ Implemented useWorkflowActions hook for manual trigger and sync operations
- ✅ Created utility functions for workflow status formatting and helpers
- ✅ All hooks and utilities tested with TypeScript type checking - no errors

## Implementation Details

### TypeScript Types (frontend/src/types/workflow.ts)
- Complete workflow data structures matching n8n API
- Execution status and health status types
- API response interfaces with proper typing
- Query configuration types for React Query
- Form and modal interfaces for UI components

### Data Hooks (frontend/src/hooks/)

#### useWorkflowData.ts
- `useWorkflowData()` - Fetches workflow lists with filtering and pagination
- `useWorkflow()` - Fetches individual workflow details
- `useWorkflowExecutions()` - Fetches execution history with filtering
- `useWorkflowExecutionHistory()` - Specialized hook for workflow execution history
- `useWorkflowQueryInvalidation()` - Utility for cache invalidation

#### useWorkflowStatus.ts
- `useWorkflowDashboard()` - Fetches dashboard summary data
- `useWorkflowHealth()` - Fetches system health status
- `useWorkflowOverview()` - Combined dashboard and health data
- `useWorkflowMonitoring()` - Real-time monitoring with fast refresh
- `useWorkflowMetrics()` - Calculated metrics from dashboard data

#### useWorkflowActions.ts
- `useTriggerWorkflow()` - Manual workflow triggering
- `useSyncWorkflows()` - Workflow synchronization from n8n
- `useFullSync()` - Complete force sync of all workflows
- `useSelectiveSync()` - Selective workflow synchronization
- `useWorkflowActions()` - Combined actions hook
- `useBatchWorkflowActions()` - Batch operations
- `useWorkflowActionPolling()` - Status polling for long-running actions

### Utility Functions (frontend/src/utils/workflowHelpers.ts)
- Status configuration objects with colors and icons
- Workflow and execution status helpers
- Duration and time formatting functions
- Health score calculation
- Payload validation
- Search and filtering utilities
- Trend analysis functions

## API Integration
- All hooks properly integrated with existing apiClient
- Follows established TanStack Query patterns
- Proper error handling and loading states
- Cache invalidation strategies implemented
- Type-safe API responses throughout

## Ready for Stream B
The data layer is complete and provides all necessary hooks and utilities for Stream B (dashboard components) to implement the UI without any data fetching concerns.

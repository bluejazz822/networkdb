# Stream A: Data Layer and API Integration

## Scope
Implement data hooks, API integration, TypeScript types, and utility functions for workflow management.

## Files
- frontend/src/hooks/useWorkflowData.ts
- frontend/src/hooks/useWorkflowStatus.ts
- frontend/src/hooks/useWorkflowActions.ts
- frontend/src/types/workflow.ts
- frontend/src/utils/workflowHelpers.ts

## Progress
- ✅ Created comprehensive TypeScript types for workflow data structures
- ✅ Implemented useWorkflowData hook with TanStack Query for fetching workflow lists and individual workflows
- ✅ Implemented useWorkflowStatus hook for dashboard summary and health monitoring data
- ✅ Implemented useWorkflowActions hook for manual trigger and sync operations
- ✅ Created utility functions for workflow status formatting and helpers
- ✅ All hooks and utilities tested with TypeScript type checking - no errors

## Implementation Details

### TypeScript Types (frontend/src/types/workflow.ts)
- Complete workflow data structures matching n8n API
- Execution status and health status types
- API response interfaces with proper typing
- Query configuration types for React Query
- Form and modal interfaces for UI components

### Data Hooks (frontend/src/hooks/)

#### useWorkflowData.ts
- `useWorkflowData()` - Fetches workflow lists with filtering and pagination
- `useWorkflow()` - Fetches individual workflow details
- `useWorkflowExecutions()` - Fetches execution history with filtering
- `useWorkflowExecutionHistory()` - Specialized hook for workflow execution history
- `useWorkflowQueryInvalidation()` - Utility for cache invalidation

#### useWorkflowStatus.ts
- `useWorkflowDashboard()` - Fetches dashboard summary data
- `useWorkflowHealth()` - Fetches system health status
- `useWorkflowOverview()` - Combined dashboard and health data
- `useWorkflowMonitoring()` - Real-time monitoring with fast refresh
- `useWorkflowMetrics()` - Calculated metrics from dashboard data

#### useWorkflowActions.ts
- `useTriggerWorkflow()` - Manual workflow triggering
- `useSyncWorkflows()` - Workflow synchronization from n8n
- `useFullSync()` - Complete force sync of all workflows
- `useSelectiveSync()` - Selective workflow synchronization
- `useWorkflowActions()` - Combined actions hook
- `useBatchWorkflowActions()` - Batch operations
- `useWorkflowActionPolling()` - Status polling for long-running actions

### Utility Functions (frontend/src/utils/workflowHelpers.ts)
- Status configuration objects with colors and icons
- Workflow and execution status helpers
- Duration and time formatting functions
- Health score calculation
- Payload validation
- Search and filtering utilities
- Trend analysis functions

## API Integration
- All hooks properly integrated with existing apiClient
- Follows established TanStack Query patterns
- Proper error handling and loading states
- Cache invalidation strategies implemented
- Type-safe API responses throughout

## Ready for Stream B
The data layer is complete and provides all necessary hooks and utilities for Stream B (dashboard components) to implement the UI without any data fetching concerns.

# Stream A Update: Manual Sync Modal Implementation

## Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETED

### Components Implemented

#### 1. ManualSyncModal Component (`frontend/src/components/ManualSyncModal.tsx`)
- ✅ Complete modal component with three sync types:
  - **Full Sync (Standard)**: Incremental sync of all workflows
  - **Selective Sync**: User-selected workflows with search functionality
  - **Force Full Sync (Advanced)**: Complete refresh with confirmation dialog
- ✅ Real-time sync statistics and risk assessment
- ✅ Workflow selection interface with search and filtering
- ✅ Confirmation dialogs for high-risk operations
- ✅ Proper loading states and error handling
- ✅ Responsive design following Ant Design patterns

#### 2. WorkflowStatusGrid Integration
- ✅ Added "Manual Sync" button to main grid toolbar
- ✅ Integrated ManualSyncModal with proper state management
- ✅ Success callback to refresh data after sync completion
- ✅ Modal open/close state handling

#### 3. WorkflowStatusCard Enhancement
- ✅ Added "Sync Individual" option to workflow dropdown menus
- ✅ Individual workflow sync capability
- ✅ Proper prop passing and event handling

#### 4. Comprehensive Testing (`frontend/src/components/__tests__/ManualSyncModal.test.tsx`)
- ✅ 50+ test cases covering all functionality:
  - Basic rendering and UI components
  - Sync type selection and switching
  - Workflow selection and search
  - Preselected workflows handling
  - Sync execution and confirmation dialogs
  - Loading states and error handling
  - Accessibility compliance
  - Edge cases and error scenarios

### Technical Features

#### Sync Type Options
1. **Full Sync**: Standard incremental sync (2-5 minutes, low risk)
2. **Selective Sync**: Choose specific workflows (30s-2min, low risk)
3. **Force Full Sync**: Complete refresh (5-15min, high risk with confirmation)

#### Workflow Selection
- Search and filter functionality
- Select all/clear all batch operations
- Visual workflow status indicators
- Real-time selection count and statistics

#### Risk Management
- Risk level indicators (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH)
- Confirmation dialogs for high-risk operations
- Large batch operation warnings
- Clear time estimates and impact descriptions

#### User Experience
- Statistics dashboard showing affected workflows
- Real-time updates of selection impact
- Progressive disclosure of advanced options
- Proper loading and disabled states during operations

### Integration Points
- Seamless integration with existing `useWorkflowActions` hooks
- Proper data refresh after successful synchronization
- Consistent error handling through message system
- Follows established modal patterns from ExportModal

### Code Quality
- TypeScript typed throughout
- Comprehensive error handling
- Accessibility compliant
- Performance optimized with useCallback and useMemo
- Follows existing code patterns and conventions

## Stream A Final Status: COMPLETE ✅

All manual sync modal functionality has been implemented and tested. The component is ready for production use and provides:
- Three distinct sync operation types
- Comprehensive workflow selection capabilities
- Risk-appropriate confirmation flows
- Full integration with existing workflow management system
- Extensive test coverage ensuring reliability

The implementation follows all established patterns and provides a robust, user-friendly interface for manual workflow synchronization operations.

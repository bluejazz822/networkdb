# Task: Python Script Integration Service

## Description
Develop a comprehensive service for managing, executing, and monitoring Python scripts within the Network CMDB system. This includes script execution APIs, scheduling capabilities, parameter configuration, and comprehensive logging and alerting for script failures.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Python script execution API with secure sandboxing
- [ ] Script upload and version management system
- [ ] Parameter configuration interface for dynamic script inputs
- [ ] Real-time script execution monitoring and status tracking
- [ ] Comprehensive execution logs with error details and stack traces
- [ ] Script scheduling system with cron-like capabilities
- [ ] Alert notifications for script failures via email and dashboard
- [ ] Script dependency management and environment isolation
- [ ] Timeout handling and resource usage monitoring
- [ ] Script output capture and structured result storage

## Technical Details
**Service Architecture:**
- FastAPI-based REST API for script management
- Celery worker processes for script execution
- Docker containers for script isolation and security
- Redis for task queuing and status tracking
- PostgreSQL for script metadata and execution history
- File system or S3 for script storage and versioning

**Key Components to Implement:**
- `ScriptManager` - Upload, version, and manage Python scripts
- `ExecutionEngine` - Secure script execution with sandboxing
- `ScheduleService` - Cron-based scheduling with recurring tasks
- `MonitoringService` - Real-time status tracking and logging
- `AlertManager` - Notification system for failures and completions
- `ParameterConfig` - Dynamic parameter injection system

**File Locations:**
- `/backend/services/scripts/` - Core script management services
- `/backend/api/scripts/` - REST API endpoints for script operations
- `/backend/workers/` - Celery worker configurations
- `/backend/models/scripts/` - Database models for script metadata
- `/scripts/sandbox/` - Isolated execution environment
- `/scripts/templates/` - Pre-built script templates

**Security Considerations:**
- Script execution in isolated Docker containers
- Resource limits (CPU, memory, execution time)
- File system access restrictions
- Network access controls for external API calls
- Input validation and sanitization for script parameters

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001: Core infrastructure and environment setup
- [ ] Task 003: Database integration and ORM configuration
- [ ] Docker runtime environment configured
- [ ] Celery and Redis message broker setup
- [ ] Email service for alert notifications

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 14
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented with comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Unit tests for script execution logic (>90% coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests for scheduling and monitoring
- [ ] Security testing for container isolation and resource limits
- [ ] Load testing for concurrent script execution
- [ ] Documentation for script development guidelines
- [ ] API documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger integration
- [ ] Code reviewed with focus on security and performance
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured for service health
- [ ] Deployed to staging with example scripts and templates

# Task: Advanced Search and Filtering API

## Description
Implement sophisticated search and filtering capabilities for network resources with full-text search, advanced multi-criteria filtering, saved queries functionality, auto-complete features, and performance optimization for large datasets. Enable users to efficiently discover and filter network resources across all entity types.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Full-text search implemented across all network resource fields
- [ ] Advanced filtering by multiple criteria (tags, regions, types, status)
- [ ] Pagination system with configurable page sizes
- [ ] Saved queries functionality with user-specific storage
- [ ] Auto-complete API for search suggestions
- [ ] Performance optimization with indexing and query optimization
- [ ] Search result ranking and relevance scoring

## Technical Details
- **Search Engine**: PostgreSQL full-text search with tsvector indexing
- **Query Builder**: Dynamic query construction with parameterized queries
- **Caching**: Redis for search result caching and auto-complete
- **Performance**: Database indexes on searchable fields
- **File Locations**:
  - `/src/api/routes/search.ts` - Search and filter endpoints
  - `/src/services/search.service.ts` - Search business logic
  - `/src/repositories/search.repository.ts` - Search data access
  - `/src/utils/query-builder.ts` - Dynamic query construction
  - `/src/middleware/search-cache.ts` - Search result caching

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 004: Core CRUD API Implementation (base API infrastructure)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 16
- Parallel: true

# Epic: Network CMDB Frontend Dashboard

## Overview

A modern web-based CMDB frontend that provides intuitive CRUD operations for 100,000+ cloud network resources with role-based access control, advanced search/filtering, bulk import/export capabilities, and comprehensive reporting. The solution leverages existing MySQL database infrastructure and integrates with Python synchronization scripts for automated data updates.

## Architecture Decisions

**Technology Stack:**
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript for type safety and scalability
- **UI Framework**: Ant Design or Material-UI for enterprise-grade components
- **State Management**: React Query + Zustand for server state and client state
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js for RESTful API layer
- **Database**: Direct MySQL integration with connection pooling (Sequelize ORM)
- **Authentication**: Passport.js with local/LDAP/SAML strategies
- **File Processing**: multer + csv-parser/xlsx for import/export
- **Deployment**: Docker containers with nginx reverse proxy

**Key Design Patterns:**
- Repository pattern for data access abstraction
- Service layer for business logic separation  
- Middleware-based authentication and authorization
- Component composition over inheritance for UI
- Event-driven architecture for audit logging

## Technical Approach

### Frontend Components
- **Main Dashboard**: Resource overview with summary widgets and quick actions
- **Resource Management**: Paginated data grid with inline editing and bulk operations
- **Advanced Search**: Filter builder with saved queries and real-time suggestions
- **Import/Export**: Drag-drop upload with validation preview and progress tracking
- **Report Builder**: Drag-drop interface for custom report creation
- **User Management**: Role-based user administration with authentication settings
- **Script Monitor**: Python script scheduling and execution status dashboard

### Backend Services
- **Authentication Service**: Multi-strategy authentication with session management
- **Resource API**: RESTful CRUD endpoints with pagination, filtering, and bulk operations
- **Import/Export Service**: File processing with validation and rollback capabilities
- **Report Service**: Dynamic report generation with caching and scheduling
- **Script Integration Service**: Python script execution and monitoring
- **Audit Service**: Change tracking and compliance logging

### Infrastructure
- **Database Optimization**: Indexed queries, connection pooling, read replicas
- **Caching**: Redis for session storage and frequently accessed data
- **File Storage**: Local filesystem with configurable paths for imports/exports
- **Monitoring**: Health checks, performance metrics, and error alerting
- **Security**: HTTPS termination, input validation, SQL injection prevention

## Implementation Strategy

**Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4): Core Foundation**
- Database schema analysis and API design
- Authentication framework setup
- Basic CRUD operations for network resources
- Simple search and pagination

**Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8): Enhanced Features**
- Advanced search with filtering
- Bulk import/export functionality  
- Basic reporting capabilities
- Role-based access control

**Phase 3 (Weeks 9-12): Advanced Features**
- Custom report builder
- Python script integration
- Performance optimization
- Security hardening and testing

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Early database performance testing with large datasets
- Authentication integration testing in isolated environment
- Incremental deployment with feature flags
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

## Task Breakdown Preview

- Python script integration and monitoring

## Estimated Effort

**Overall Timeline:** 12 weeks (MVP delivery)
- Phase 1 (Foundation): 4 weeks
- Phase 2 (Core Features): 4 weeks  
- Phase 3 (Advanced Features): 4 weeks

**Resource Requirements:**
- 1 Full-stack Developer (primary)

- DevOps Engineer (deployment setup, 15% time)

**Critical Path Items:**
1. Database schema analysis and API design (Week 1-2)
2. Authentication framework integration (Week 3-4)
3. Performance optimization for large datasets (Week 9-10)
4. Security review and penetration testing (Week 11-12)

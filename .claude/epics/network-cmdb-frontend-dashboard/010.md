# Task: Security Hardening and Performance Optimization

## Description
Comprehensive security audit and performance optimization of the Network CMDB system to handle enterprise-scale deployments with 100,000+ network resources. This includes security hardening, caching implementation, performance tuning, and load testing to ensure production readiness.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Security audit completed with penetration testing results
- [ ] All critical and high-severity vulnerabilities remediated
- [ ] Performance optimization achieving <2s response times for 100K+ records
- [ ] Redis caching layer implemented with intelligent cache invalidation
- [ ] Database query optimization with proper indexing strategy
- [ ] Load testing completed supporting 1000+ concurrent users
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting system configured for production
- [ ] Security headers and HTTPS enforcement implemented
- [ ] Rate limiting and DDoS protection configured
- [ ] Data encryption at rest and in transit verified

## Technical Details
**Security Hardening:**
- OWASP Top 10 vulnerability assessment and remediation
- SQL injection and XSS protection verification
- Authentication and authorization security review
- API security with proper input validation and sanitization
- Container security scanning and hardening
- Secrets management with proper key rotation

**Performance Optimization:**
- Database query optimization with execution plan analysis
- API response caching with Redis integration
- Frontend bundle optimization and code splitting
- CDN integration for static asset delivery
- Database connection pooling and optimization
- Memory usage optimization and garbage collection tuning

**Key Components to Implement:**
- `CacheManager` - Intelligent caching with TTL and invalidation strategies
- `SecurityMiddleware` - Comprehensive security headers and protection
- `PerformanceMonitor` - Real-time performance metrics collection
- `LoadBalancer` - Request distribution and failover configuration
- `AlertSystem` - Production monitoring and incident response
- `BackupService` - Automated backup and disaster recovery

**File Locations:**
- `/backend/middleware/security/` - Security middleware and protection
- `/backend/services/cache/` - Redis caching implementation
- `/backend/monitoring/` - Performance monitoring services
- `/infrastructure/` - Load balancer and infrastructure configurations
- `/scripts/optimization/` - Database optimization scripts
- `/tests/load/` - Load testing scripts and configurations

**Performance Targets:**
- API response times: <2 seconds for complex queries
- Database query performance: <500ms for indexed searches
- Frontend load time: <3 seconds initial load, <1 second navigation
- Memory usage: <2GB per service instance
- CPU utilization: <70% under normal load

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 004: Database schema and API implementation completed
- [ ] Task 007: Frontend components and layout finalized
- [ ] Redis server configured and available
- [ ] Load testing tools (Artillery, JMeter) configured
- [ ] Security scanning tools (OWASP ZAP, Bandit) available

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 20
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Security audit report completed with all high/critical issues resolved
- [ ] Performance benchmarks achieved and documented
- [ ] Load testing completed with 1000+ concurrent users
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards configured with key metrics
- [ ] Alerting rules configured for critical system events
- [ ] Documentation updated with security and performance guidelines
- [ ] Disaster recovery procedures documented and tested
- [ ] Code reviewed with security and performance focus
- [ ] Production deployment checklist completed
- [ ] System validated by security team and performance engineers

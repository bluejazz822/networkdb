## Configuration Files Created

1. **`src/config/environment.ts`** - Environment variable management
2. **`src/config/database.ts`** - Database connection configuration  
3. **`src/utils/db-connection.ts`** - Connection utilities and management
4. **`src/utils/db-health-check.ts`** - Health monitoring system
5. **`.env.example`** - Environment configuration template
6. **`package.json`** - Project dependencies
7. **`tsconfig.json`** - TypeScript configuration

## Stream B Handoffs

### To Stream D (Performance Optimization) - Hour 6 ⏰
**Ready for handoff:** ✅

**Files to share:**
- `src/config/database.ts` - Connection configuration
- `src/utils/db-connection.ts` - Connection utilities
- Connection pool configuration and metrics

**Handoff Details:**
- Connection pooling is fully configured with optimized defaults
- Health monitoring system is implemented and ready for enhancement
- Performance metrics collection is in place
- All connection utilities include timing and monitoring hooks

## Testing Recommendations

### Unit Tests Needed
- Environment configuration validation
- Database connection establishment
- Error handling scenarios  
- Health check functionality
- Connection metrics calculation

### Integration Tests Needed
- End-to-end connection establishment
- Transaction rollback scenarios
- Connection pool behavior under load
- Health monitoring accuracy
- SSL connection validation

## Usage Examples

### Basic Connection
```typescript
import { initializeDbConnection } from '@/utils/db-connection';

// Initialize connection
await initializeDbConnection();
```

### Query Execution
```typescript
import { executeQuery } from '@/utils/db-connection';

const results = await executeQuery(
  'SELECT * FROM devices WHERE status = ?',
  { status: 'active' }
);
```

### Health Check
```typescript
import { healthMonitor } from '@/utils/db-health-check';

const health = await healthMonitor.performHealthCheck();
console.log(`Database status: ${health.status}`);
```

## Environment Setup Instructions

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Configure database credentials
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Run health check: `npm run db:health`

## Next Steps for Other Streams

### Stream A: Schema Analysis
Can proceed with connection utilities available for schema inspection.

### Stream C: Migration System  
Can use the database configuration for migration setup.

### Stream D: Performance Optimization
Ready to receive connection configuration for optimization work.

## Notes

- All files follow TypeScript best practices with strict typing
- Error handling includes comprehensive logging and metrics
- Configuration supports development, test, and production environments
- Connection pooling is optimized for high-performance scenarios
- Health monitoring provides both programmatic and CLI interfaces
- Code is ready for immediate use by dependent streams

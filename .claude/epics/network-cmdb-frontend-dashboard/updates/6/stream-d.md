# Stream D Progress: Performance Optimization & Monitoring

## Status: In Progress
**Stream**: D - Performance Optimization & Monitoring  
**Issue**: #6 - Database Integration and Schema Analysis  
**Start Time**: 2025-09-04 23:18:00  

## Objectives
1. **Connection Pool Optimization**: Configure optimal pool settings for 100K+ records and 50+ concurrent users
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Implement query performance tracking and slow query logging  
3. **Database Indexing**: Design and implement indexing strategy for fast search and filtering
4. **Caching Strategy**: Plan Redis integration for frequently accessed data
5. **Performance Metrics**: Create performance monitoring dashboard utilities

## Target Metrics
- Search response time: <2 seconds
- Support: 100K+ records
- Concurrent users: 50+
- Connection pool efficiency: >90%

## Files to Implement
- [x] `src/config/pool-config.ts` - Connection pool optimization
- [x] `src/utils/db-monitor.ts` - Performance monitoring utilities
- [x] `src/database/indexes.sql` - Database indexing strategy

## Dependencies & Coordination Points
- **Hour 6**: Waiting for connection setup from Stream B
- **Schema Info**: Need schema information from Stream A for indexing decisions
- **Current Status**: Working on foundational framework that doesn't depend on other streams

# Stream D Progress: Performance Optimization & Monitoring

## Status: In Progress
**Stream**: D - Performance Optimization & Monitoring  
**Issue**: #6 - Database Integration and Schema Analysis  
**Start Time**: 2025-09-04 23:18:00  

## Objectives
1. **Connection Pool Optimization**: Configure optimal pool settings for 100K+ records and 50+ concurrent users
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Implement query performance tracking and slow query logging  
3. **Database Indexing**: Design and implement indexing strategy for fast search and filtering
4. **Caching Strategy**: Plan Redis integration for frequently accessed data
5. **Performance Metrics**: Create performance monitoring dashboard utilities

## Target Metrics
- Search response time: <2 seconds
- Support: 100K+ records
- Concurrent users: 50+
- Connection pool efficiency: >90%

## Files to Implement
- [x] `src/config/pool-config.ts` - Connection pool optimization
- [x] `src/utils/db-monitor.ts` - Performance monitoring utilities
- [x] `src/database/indexes.sql` - Database indexing strategy

## Dependencies & Coordination Points
- **Hour 6**: Waiting for connection setup from Stream B
- **Schema Info**: Need schema information from Stream A for indexing decisions
- **Current Status**: Working on foundational framework that doesn't depend on other streams

## Progress Log

### 2025-09-04 23:18:00 - Initial Setup
- [x] Created project directory structure
- [x] Set up Stream D progress tracking
- [x] Started with connection pool configuration framework

### 2025-09-04 23:30:00 - Core Implementation Complete
- [x] **pool-config.ts**: Complete connection pool configuration with production/dev/test environments
  - Optimized for 50+ concurrent users
  - Performance thresholds and monitoring hooks
  - Health check configuration
  - Retry logic for transient failures
- [x] **db-monitor.ts**: Comprehensive performance monitoring framework
  - Query performance tracking with metrics collection
  - Connection pool monitoring
  - Slow query detection and alerting
  - Performance reporting and recommendations
  - Connection leak detection
- [x] **indexes.sql**: Complete indexing strategy template
  - Optimized for 100K+ records and <2s response time
  - Primary lookups, search optimization, join optimization
  - Temporal data indexes for monitoring queries
  - Index maintenance procedures and monitoring queries

## Completed Tasks
1. ✅ Project structure created (`src/config/`, `src/utils/`, `src/database/`)
2. ✅ Progress tracking file initialized
3. ✅ Connection pool configuration implemented in `src/config/pool-config.ts`
4. ✅ Performance monitoring utilities implemented in `src/utils/db-monitor.ts`
5. ✅ Database indexing strategy template created in `src/database/indexes.sql`

## Current Status
**Phase 1 Complete**: All foundational Stream D files implemented
- Ready for coordination points with other streams
- Frameworks in place for performance optimization

## Next Steps
1. ✅ ~~Implement pool-config.ts with performance-optimized settings~~
2. ✅ ~~Create db-monitor.ts utilities framework~~
3. ✅ ~~Design indexing strategy template~~
4. **WAITING**: Coordination points with other streams
   - Hour 6: Integration with Stream B connection setup
   - Schema analysis: Customize indexes based on Stream A schema

## Performance Baseline Planning
- Connection pool metrics tracking
- Query execution time monitoring
- Resource usage monitoring
- Slow query identification and logging

## Notes
- Following fail-fast error handling philosophy
- Implementing graceful degradation for optional features
- Planning for 100K+ record optimization from start

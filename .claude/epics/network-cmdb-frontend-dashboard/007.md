# Task: Frontend Core Components and Layout

## Description
Develop comprehensive React frontend components and responsive layout system for the Network CMDB dashboard. This includes core CRUD components for resource management, main dashboard interface with navigation, and complete UI state management integration.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Resource management components (Create, Read, Update, Delete) implemented with proper validation
- [ ] Search and filtering components with advanced query capabilities
- [ ] Data grid components with pagination, sorting, and column customization
- [ ] Main dashboard layout with responsive design and widget system
- [ ] Navigation system with breadcrumbs and role-based menu items
- [ ] Ant Design integration with consistent theming and component library
- [ ] State management implemented using React Query for server state and Zustand for client state
- [ ] Form validation and error handling with user-friendly messages
- [ ] Loading states and skeleton components for improved UX
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design supporting tablets and smartphones

## Technical Details
**Frontend Architecture:**
- React 18 with TypeScript for type safety
- Ant Design 5.x for UI components and design system
- React Query (TanStack Query) for server state management and caching
- Zustand for lightweight client-side state management
- React Router v6 for navigation and routing
- React Hook Form for efficient form handling

**Key Components to Implement:**
- `ResourceGrid` - Data table with CRUD operations
- `ResourceForm` - Dynamic form builder for different resource types
- `SearchFilter` - Advanced search with multiple criteria
- `Dashboard` - Main layout with widget containers
- `Navigation` - Sidebar and header navigation components
- `ResourceDetails` - Detail view with tabs and related data

**File Locations:**
- `/src/components/` - Reusable UI components
- `/src/pages/` - Page-level components and layouts
- `/src/hooks/` - Custom React hooks for data fetching
- `/src/store/` - Zustand store configurations
- `/src/types/` - TypeScript type definitions
- `/src/utils/` - Utility functions and helpers

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 002: API endpoint development completed
- [ ] Task 004: Database schema and models finalized
- [ ] Node.js and npm/yarn package manager installed
- [ ] React development environment configured

## Effort Estimate
- Size: XL
- Hours: 28
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented with TypeScript and proper type definitions
- [ ] Unit tests written using Jest and React Testing Library (>80% coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests for key user workflows
- [ ] Storybook documentation for all reusable components
- [ ] Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA) verified
- [ ] Performance optimized (Lighthouse score >90)
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by senior developer
- [ ] Responsive design tested on multiple devices and browsers
- [ ] Deployed to staging environment and QA validated

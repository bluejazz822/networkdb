# Task: Project Structure and Development Environment

## Description
Establish a comprehensive development environment and project structure for the Network CMDB frontend dashboard. This includes setting up React with TypeScript and Ant Design for the frontend, Node.js/Express backend structure, development tooling, linting, build configuration, and Docker containerization for consistent deployment across environments.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] React + TypeScript project structure established with proper component organization
- [ ] Ant Design UI library integrated with custom theming
- [ ] Node.js/Express backend structure with TypeScript support
- [ ] ESLint and Prettier configured for code consistency
- [ ] Build system configured with webpack/Vite for development and production
- [ ] Docker containers created for frontend, backend, and database
- [ ] Docker Compose configuration for local development
- [ ] Hot reload functionality working for both frontend and backend
- [ ] Environment variable management system implemented

## Technical Details
### Implementation Approach
- **Frontend**: React 18+ with TypeScript, Ant Design for UI components
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express framework and TypeScript
- **Build Tools**: Vite for frontend, tsc for backend compilation
- **Linting**: ESLint with TypeScript rules, Prettier for formatting
- **Containerization**: Multi-stage Docker builds for optimization

### Technologies
- React 18+, TypeScript 4.9+
- Ant Design 5.0+
- Node.js 18+, Express 4.18+
- Vite, ESLint, Prettier
- Docker, Docker Compose
- GitHub Actions (future CI/CD)

### File Locations
- `frontend/` - React application directory
- `backend/` - Express server directory
- `docker/` - Docker configuration files
- `docker-compose.yml` - Local development orchestration
- `.eslintrc.js`, `.prettierrc` - Code quality configuration
- `package.json` - Project dependencies and scripts

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001 (Database Integration) completed for backend database connection
- [ ] Node.js and Docker installed on development machines
- [ ] Package registry access for npm dependencies

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 16
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Frontend and backend code structure implemented
- [ ] All development tools configured and working
- [ ] Docker containers built and tested
- [ ] Local development environment fully functional
- [ ] Build scripts and deployment processes documented
- [ ] Code style guides documented and enforced
- [ ] Development setup instructions created
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Successfully deployed to staging environment using Docker

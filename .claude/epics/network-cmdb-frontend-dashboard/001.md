# Task: Database Integration and Schema Analysis

## Description
Establish the foundational database layer for the Network CMDB frontend dashboard by setting up MySQL connection, implementing Sequelize ORM, analyzing existing database schema, and creating corresponding data models. This includes optimizing database connections through connection pooling and implementing performance monitoring.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] MySQL database connection established with proper error handling
- [ ] Sequelize ORM configured with appropriate connection settings
- [ ] Database schema fully analyzed and documented
- [ ] Sequelize models created for all relevant database entities
- [ ] Connection pooling implemented for performance optimization
- [ ] Database performance monitoring and logging configured
- [ ] Migration system setup for schema changes

## Technical Details
### Implementation Approach
- **Database Connection**: MySQL with connection pooling using Sequelize
- **ORM Configuration**: Sequelize with TypeScript support
- **Schema Analysis**: Reverse engineering existing database structure
- **Model Generation**: Automated model generation with manual refinement
- **Performance**: Connection pool configuration, query optimization

### Technologies
- MySQL 8.0+
- Sequelize ORM
- TypeScript
- Connection pooling
- Database migration tools

### File Locations
- `src/config/database.ts` - Database configuration
- `src/models/` - Sequelize models directory
- `src/migrations/` - Database migration files
- `src/utils/db-connection.ts` - Connection management utilities

## Dependencies
- [ ] MySQL database server availability
- [ ] Database credentials and connection parameters
- [ ] Existing database schema documentation (if available)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 24
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented with proper TypeScript types
- [ ] Unit tests written for database connection and models
- [ ] Integration tests for database operations
- [ ] Performance tests for connection pooling
- [ ] Documentation updated with database schema and model relationships
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Database connection tested in staging environment

# Task: Import/Export Engine Implementation

## Description
Develop comprehensive import/export system supporting multiple file formats (CSV, Excel, JSON) with validation and preview workflow, bulk operations with rollback capability, and detailed progress tracking with error reporting. Enable users to efficiently manage large-scale data operations while maintaining data integrity.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Multi-format file processing support (CSV, Excel XLSX, JSON)
- [ ] File validation with detailed error reporting before processing
- [ ] Preview workflow showing proposed changes before commit
- [ ] Bulk import operations with transaction rollback on failure
- [ ] Bulk export with filtering and custom field selection
- [ ] Progress tracking with real-time status updates
- [ ] Detailed error reporting with line-by-line validation results
- [ ] Template generation for each supported format

## Technical Details
- **File Processing**: 
  - CSV: `csv-parser` and `csv-stringify`
  - Excel: `xlsx` library for XLSX files
  - JSON: Native JSON parsing with schema validation
- **Validation**: Schema-based validation with detailed error reporting
- **Transactions**: Database transactions for atomicity
- **Progress Tracking**: WebSocket or SSE for real-time updates
- **File Locations**:
  - `/src/api/routes/import-export.ts` - Import/export endpoints
  - `/src/services/import.service.ts` - Import processing logic
  - `/src/services/export.service.ts` - Export processing logic
  - `/src/utils/file-processors/` - Format-specific processors
  - `/src/utils/validators/` - Data validation utilities
  - `/src/middleware/file-upload.ts` - File upload handling

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001: Development Environment Setup (file storage, processing tools)
- [ ] Task 003: Database Schema and Models (data structure for validation)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 18
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done

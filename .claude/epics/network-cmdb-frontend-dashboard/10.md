# Task: Authentication System Implementation

## Description
Implement a comprehensive authentication system for the Network CMDB frontend dashboard using Passport.js with support for multiple authentication strategies including local authentication, LDAP integration, and SAML SSO. The system will include session management, role-based access control (RBAC), and proper security middleware for protecting API endpoints and frontend routes.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Passport.js configured with local authentication strategy
- [ ] LDAP authentication integration for enterprise directory services
- [ ] SAML SSO support for identity provider integration
- [ ] Session management with secure session storage
- [ ] Role-based access control system with configurable permissions
- [ ] Authentication middleware for API endpoint protection
- [ ] Frontend route protection with role-based navigation
- [ ] Secure logout functionality with session cleanup
- [ ] Password policies and security measures implemented

## Technical Details
### Implementation Approach
- **Authentication Framework**: Passport.js with multiple strategies
- **Session Management**: Express-session with secure configuration
- **RBAC System**: Role and permission-based access control
- **Security**: CSRF protection, secure headers, input validation
- **Frontend Integration**: Authentication context and protected routes

### Technologies
- Passport.js with local, LDAP, and SAML strategies
- Express-session for session management
- bcrypt for password hashing
- JWT for stateless authentication (optional)
- React Context API for authentication state
- Ant Design for login/auth UI components

### File Locations
- `backend/src/auth/` - Authentication strategies and middleware
- `backend/src/middleware/auth.ts` - Authentication middleware
- `backend/src/models/User.ts` - User model with roles
- `frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Authentication context
- `frontend/src/components/auth/` - Login and auth-related components
- `frontend/src/utils/auth.ts` - Authentication utilities

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001 (Database Integration) completed for user data storage
- [ ] LDAP server configuration details (if using LDAP)
- [ ] SAML identity provider configuration (if using SAML)
- [ ] SSL certificates for secure authentication

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 20
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All authentication strategies implemented and tested
- [ ] Role-based access control system fully functional
- [ ] Security middleware protecting all sensitive endpoints
- [ ] Frontend authentication state management working
- [ ] Comprehensive unit tests for authentication logic
- [ ] Integration tests for auth flows
- [ ] Security testing completed (penetration testing basics)
- [ ] Authentication documentation created
- [ ] Code reviewed with security focus
- [ ] Successfully tested in staging with all auth methods

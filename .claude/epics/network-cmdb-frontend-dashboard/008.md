# Task: Reporting System Implementation

## Description
Implement a comprehensive reporting system with interactive dashboard widgets, custom report builder interface, and automated report generation capabilities. The system will provide both real-time dashboards and scheduled report delivery with multiple export formats.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Dashboard widgets displaying key metrics (resource counts, health status, utilization)
- [ ] Interactive charts and graphs with drill-down capabilities
- [ ] Custom report builder with drag-and-drop interface for field selection
- [ ] Report templates for common use cases (inventory, compliance, performance)
- [ ] Export functionality supporting PDF, Excel, CSV, and JSON formats
- [ ] Scheduled report generation with email delivery
- [ ] Report history and version management
- [ ] User-specific report permissions and sharing capabilities
- [ ] Real-time data refresh and caching for performance
- [ ] Report preview functionality before generation

## Technical Details
**Reporting Architecture:**
- Chart.js or D3.js for interactive visualizations
- React-based drag-and-drop report builder
- Backend report generation service using Python/FastAPI
- Redis caching for frequently accessed reports
- Celery for background report processing
- Email service integration for report delivery

**Key Components to Implement:**
- `DashboardWidget` - Configurable widget system for metrics display
- `ReportBuilder` - Drag-and-drop interface for custom reports
- `ChartComponents` - Reusable chart components (bar, line, pie, donut)
- `ExportService` - Multi-format export functionality
- `ScheduleManager` - Report scheduling and automation
- `ReportTemplates` - Pre-built report configurations

**File Locations:**
- `/src/components/reports/` - Report-related React components
- `/src/services/reports/` - Report API service integrations
- `/backend/reports/` - Python report generation services
- `/backend/tasks/` - Celery task definitions for report processing
- `/templates/reports/` - Report template configurations

**Export Formats:**
- PDF: Using jsPDF or Puppeteer for client/server-side generation
- Excel: Using ExcelJS or similar library
- CSV: Native JavaScript/Python CSV generation
- JSON: Structured data export for API integration

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 002: API endpoints for data access completed
- [ ] Task 004: Database schema with proper indexing for reporting queries
- [ ] Redis server configured for caching
- [ ] Email service (SMTP/SendGrid) configured for delivery

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 22
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented with proper error handling and validation
- [ ] Unit tests for report generation logic (>85% coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests for export functionality and email delivery
- [ ] Performance tests for large dataset report generation
- [ ] User acceptance testing for report builder interface
- [ ] Documentation for report templates and scheduling
- [ ] Code reviewed and security assessed for data access controls
- [ ] Load testing completed for concurrent report generation
- [ ] Deployed to staging with monitoring and alerting configured

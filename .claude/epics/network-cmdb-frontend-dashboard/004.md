# Task: Core CRUD API Implementation

## Description
Implement comprehensive RESTful API endpoints for all network resources (VPC, Transit Gateway, Customer Gateway, VPC Endpoints) with full CRUD operations. Establish repository pattern with service layer architecture, robust input validation, comprehensive error handling, and audit logging for all operations.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] RESTful endpoints implemented for VPC, TGW, CGW, and VPC Endpoints resources
- [ ] Repository pattern with service layer abstraction implemented
- [ ] Input validation with detailed error responses for all endpoints
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes
- [ ] Audit logging system capturing all CRUD operations with user context
- [ ] API documentation generated (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- [ ] Integration tests covering all endpoints and error scenarios

## Technical Details
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Architecture**: Repository pattern with service layer
- **Validation**: Joi or Zod for request validation
- **Database Layer**: Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL
- **Audit System**: Structured logging with request tracing
- **File Locations**:
  - `/src/api/routes/` - API route definitions
  - `/src/services/` - Business logic layer
  - `/src/repositories/` - Data access layer
  - `/src/middleware/` - Validation and audit middleware
  - `/src/types/` - TypeScript interfaces and schemas

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001: Development Environment Setup (database, tools)
- [ ] Task 003: Database Schema and Models (data layer foundation)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 20
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented with full CRUD operations
- [ ] Repository and service patterns established
- [ ] Input validation and error handling complete
- [ ] Audit logging system operational
- [ ] Unit and integration tests written and passing
- [ ] API documentation generated and reviewed
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Deployed to staging environment

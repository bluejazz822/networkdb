# Issue #6 Analysis: Database Integration and Schema Analysis

## Work Streams

### Stream A: Database Schema Analysis & Modeling
- **Description**: Analyze existing MySQL CMDB schema structure, create comprehensive documentation, and design Sequelize data models with proper relationships
- **Files**: `src/models/`, `docs/database-schema.md`, `src/types/database.ts`
- **Agent**: code-analyzer (specialized in schema analysis and data modeling)
- **Dependencies**: None (can start immediately with database connection info)
- **Duration**: 10 hours
- **Deliverables**: Complete schema documentation, TypeScript interfaces, relationship mapping

### Stream B: Database Connection & Configuration Setup
- **Description**: Configure MySQL connection, implement Sequelize ORM setup, establish connection pooling, and create database configuration management
- **Files**: `src/config/database.ts`, `src/utils/db-connection.ts`, `src/config/environment.ts`
- **Agent**: general-purpose (infrastructure and configuration focus)
- **Dependencies**: None (can work in parallel with Stream A)
- **Duration**: 8 hours
- **Deliverables**: Working database connection, environment configuration, error handling

### Stream C: Migration System & Database Operations
- **Description**: Set up database migration system, create initial migrations based on schema analysis, implement database utilities for common operations
- **Files**: `src/migrations/`, `src/utils/migration-helper.ts`, `src/database/operations.ts`
- **Agent**: general-purpose (focused on database operations)
- **Dependencies**: Needs basic schema understanding from Stream A (coordination point at hour 4)
- **Duration**: 6 hours
- **Deliverables**: Migration framework, initial migrations, database utilities

### Stream D: Performance Optimization & Monitoring
- **Description**: Implement connection pool optimization, query performance monitoring, database indexing strategies, and logging for performance tracking
- **Files**: `src/config/pool-config.ts`, `src/utils/db-monitor.ts`, `src/database/indexes.sql`
- **Agent**: general-purpose (performance and monitoring specialist)
- **Dependencies**: Needs connection setup from Stream B and schema from Stream A
- **Duration**: 8 hours
- **Deliverables**: Optimized connection pooling, performance monitoring, indexing strategy

## Coordination Points

### Hour 4: Schema-Migration Coordination
- Stream A provides schema analysis to Stream C
- Stream A shares entity relationships with Stream C for migration planning
- **Handoff**: Schema documentation and entity definitions

### Hour 6: Connection-Performance Integration
- Stream B provides connection configuration to Stream D
- Stream B shares connection pool setup with Stream D for optimization
- **Handoff**: Database connection utilities and pool configuration

### Hour 12: Model-Migration Integration
- Stream A provides final Sequelize models to Stream C
- Stream C validates migrations against final models
- **Handoff**: Complete model definitions and migration validation

### Final Integration (Hour 20-24)
- All streams coordinate for final integration testing
- Performance optimization applied to complete system
- End-to-end testing with all components integrated

## File Conflict Prevention

**No Overlapping Files**: Each stream works on distinct file sets with no conflicts during parallel execution.

**Shared Dependencies**: 
- `package.json` updates handled in Stream B only
- TypeScript configuration managed centrally
- Test files organized by stream (e.g., `tests/models/`, `tests/config/`)

## Success Metrics

- **Stream A**: Schema documentation completeness, model relationship accuracy
- **Stream B**: Successful database connections, proper error handling
- **Stream C**: Clean migration execution, rollback capability
- **Stream D**: Connection pool efficiency, query performance baselines

## Risk Mitigation

- **Early Schema Access**: Stream A can begin with existing database inspection tools
- **Mock Data**: Stream B can use connection testing with minimal data
- **Incremental Integration**: Each stream validates independently before final merge
- **Performance Baseline**: Stream D establishes metrics before optimization

This parallel approach reduces the 24-hour sequential timeline to approximately 12-14 hours of wall-clock time while maintaining quality and avoiding conflicts.

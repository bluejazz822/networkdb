# Issue #8 Analysis: Project Structure and Development Environment

## Work Streams

### Stream A: Frontend Foundation
- **Description**: React 18+ with TypeScript and Ant Design setup, including Vite build configuration
- **Files**: `frontend/` directory (new), frontend package.json, vite.config.ts, tsconfig.json (frontend)
- **Agent**: general-purpose
- **Dependencies**: None (completely independent)
- **Duration**: 6 hours
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Create React + TypeScript project structure
  - Integrate Ant Design 5.0+ with custom theming
  - Configure Vite for development and production builds
  - Set up hot reload functionality

### Stream B: Backend Structure Reorganization
- **Description**: Restructure existing Node.js/Express backend into proper directory structure with TypeScript optimization
- **Files**: `backend/` directory (reorganize existing `src/`), backend package.json, backend tsconfig.json
- **Agent**: general-purpose  
- **Dependencies**: None (works with existing code)
- **Duration**: 4 hours
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Move existing `src/` structure to `backend/src/`
  - Update build and dev scripts for backend-specific workflow
  - Ensure TypeScript compilation works in new structure
  - Maintain existing database functionality

### Stream C: Development Tooling & Quality
- **Description**: ESLint, Prettier, and code quality configuration for both frontend and backend
- **Files**: `.eslintrc.js`, `.prettierrc`, `package.json` scripts, GitHub workflows
- **Agent**: general-purpose
- **Dependencies**: Needs Stream A and B file structures to configure properly
- **Duration**: 3 hours
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Configure ESLint with TypeScript rules for both frontend/backend
  - Set up Prettier formatting consistency
  - Create unified code quality scripts
  - Establish code style guidelines

### Stream D: Docker & Environment Management
- **Description**: Multi-stage Docker builds and Docker Compose for local development
- **Files**: `docker/`, `Dockerfile` (frontend/backend), `docker-compose.yml`, `.dockerignore`
- **Agent**: general-purpose
- **Dependencies**: Needs Stream A and B completed for proper containerization
- **Duration**: 3 hours
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Create optimized Docker containers for frontend and backend
  - Set up Docker Compose with MySQL integration
  - Configure environment variable management
  - Test container orchestration

## Coordination Points

### Critical Coordination Points
1. **Root Package.json Structure**: Streams A and B both need to modify the root package.json for monorepo workspace setup
2. **TypeScript Configuration**: Both frontend and backend need coordinated tsconfig.json files with proper path mappings
3. **Environment Variables**: Stream D needs to coordinate with A and B for proper environment variable configuration

### Suggested Execution Order
1. **Phase 1 (Parallel)**: Stream A + Stream B can run simultaneously
2. **Phase 2 (Sequential)**: Stream C (depends on A+B file structures)  
3. **Phase 3 (Sequential)**: Stream D (depends on A+B+C completion)

### File Conflict Avoidance
- **Stream A**: Works exclusively in `frontend/` (new directory)
- **Stream B**: Works exclusively in `backend/` (reorganized from `src/`)
- **Stream C**: Works on root-level config files after A+B complete
- **Stream D**: Works on Docker files after A+B+C complete

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- Node.js 18+ and Docker must be installed on development machines
- Package registry access for npm dependencies
- Issue #6 (Database Integration) should be completed for backend database connection testing

### Internal Stream Dependencies
- **Stream A**: Independent
- **Stream B**: Independent
- **Stream C**: Depends on A + B (needs file structures)
- **Stream D**: Depends on A + B + C (needs complete project structure)

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk Parallel Execution
- Streams A and B can safely run in parallel with minimal coordination
- Both work on separate directory structures
- Limited shared file modifications

### Medium Risk Areas
- Root package.json modifications need coordination
- TypeScript configuration alignment between frontend/backend
- Environment variable management across containers

### Mitigation Strategies
- Use workspace-based package.json structure to avoid conflicts
- Establish clear naming conventions early
- Regular sync points between parallel streams

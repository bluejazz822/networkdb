- **Description**: Comprehensive interface defining specialized workflow data access methods
- **Key Features**:
  - Extends BaseRepository interface for consistent CRUD operations
  - Specialized query methods for workflows by type, provider, and active status
  - Advanced filtering interfaces (WorkflowFilters, ExecutionFilters, TimeRangeFilter)
  - Dashboard metrics aggregation interfaces (WorkflowMetrics, ExecutionStatistics)
  - Performance metrics interfaces for individual workflow analysis
  - Alert management methods
  - Comprehensive TypeScript type definitions

### ✅ Task 2: Implement `WorkflowRepository` Class
- **Status**: Completed
- **File**: `/Users/sunsun/networkdb/backend/src/repositories/WorkflowRepository.ts`
- **Description**: Full implementation of workflow repository with advanced querying capabilities
- **Key Features**:
  - Extends BaseRepository following existing project patterns
  - Complete CRUD operations for WorkflowRegistry model
  - Advanced search and filtering capabilities
  - Comprehensive dashboard metrics aggregation
  - Execution history management with pagination
  - Performance analytics and statistics
  - Alert management functionality
  - Optimized SQL queries for large datasets

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Integration
- **Models Used**: WorkflowRegistry, WorkflowExecution, WorkflowAlert
- **Database Relations**: Proper foreign key relationships maintained
- **Query Optimization**: Efficient aggregation queries with proper indexing considerations
- **Pagination**: Built-in pagination support for all query methods

### Key Methods Implemented

#### Core Repository Methods
- `findByWorkflowId()`: Find workflow by unique workflow ID
- `findByType()`: Filter workflows by type (vpc, subnet, etc.)
- `findByProvider()`: Filter workflows by cloud provider
- `findByActiveStatus()`: Find active/inactive workflows
- `searchWorkflows()`: Advanced filtering with multiple criteria

#### Execution Management
- `getExecutionHistory()`: Paginated execution history for workflows
- `getExecutions()`: Comprehensive execution querying with filters
- `getFailedExecutions()`: Failed executions within time ranges
- `getRunningExecutions()`: Currently running executions
- `getWorkflowExecutionSummary()`: Summary stats for individual workflows

#### Dashboard Metrics & Analytics
- `getWorkflowMetrics()`: Comprehensive dashboard metrics aggregation
- `getExecutionStatistics()`: Detailed execution statistics with breakdowns
- `getWorkflowPerformanceMetrics()`: Individual workflow performance analysis
- `getWorkflowStatistics()`: Overall system statistics

#### Alert Management
- `getWorkflowAlerts()`: Paginated alert retrieval
- `getUnresolvedAlerts()`: Unresolved alerts only
- `resolveAlert()`: Mark alerts as resolved

#### Utility Methods
- `updateActiveStatus()`: Enable/disable workflows
- `getStaleWorkflows()`: Find workflows that haven't run recently

### Performance Optimizations

#### Database Queries
- **Aggregation Queries**: Efficient GROUP BY operations for statistics
- **Join Optimization**: Proper LEFT/INNER joins for related data
- **Pagination**: LIMIT/OFFSET implementation with count queries
- **Raw Queries**: Complex analytics queries using Sequelize raw queries

#### Caching Considerations
- **Query Results**: Methods designed for result caching at service layer
- **Aggregation Data**: Dashboard metrics suitable for periodic caching
- **Performance Metrics**: Individual workflow metrics cacheable

## Code Quality Standards

### ✅ Following Project Patterns

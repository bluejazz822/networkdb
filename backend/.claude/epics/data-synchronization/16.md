# Issue #16: REST API Endpoints for Workflow Management

## Description
Create RESTful API endpoints for the Data Synchronization module, providing frontend access to workflow status, execution history, manual triggers, and dashboard metrics. Follow existing API patterns in the codebase.

## Dependencies
- [x] Issue #15: Workflow Data Management Service (completed)
- [x] Express.js router configuration  
- [x] Authentication middleware available

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement GET /api/workflows endpoint for workflow list
- [ ] Add GET /api/workflows/:id/executions for execution history
- [ ] Create POST /api/workflows/:id/trigger for manual execution
- [ ] Add GET /api/workflows/status endpoint for dashboard summary
- [ ] Implement proper request validation and error handling
- [ ] Add authentication middleware integration
- [ ] Include comprehensive API documentation
- [ ] Create integration tests for all endpoints

## Technical Details
- **Implementation approach**: Express.js router with controller pattern
- **Key considerations**:
  - Follow existing API conventions in the codebase
  - Implement proper HTTP status codes and error responses
  - Add request rate limiting for manual triggers
  - Include pagination for execution history
- **Code locations/files affected**:
  - `backend/src/routes/workflows.ts`
  - `backend/src/controllers/WorkflowController.ts`
  - `backend/src/middleware/workflowAuth.ts`
  - `backend/tests/routes/workflows.test.ts`

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 8
- Parallel: false (depends on service layer)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All API endpoints implemented and functional
- [ ] Request validation working correctly
- [ ] Error handling returns appropriate HTTP codes
- [ ] Authentication integration working
- [ ] Rate limiting implemented for triggers
- [ ] API documentation complete
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Postman collection created for testing
